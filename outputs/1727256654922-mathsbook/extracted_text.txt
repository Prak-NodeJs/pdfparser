M y publishers, Addison-Wesley, have produced 
my books for these last eight years. I  want it 
known how much I  appreciate their extraordi­
nary performance at all levels. General editorial 
advice, specific editing of the manuscripts, and 
essentially flawless typesetting and proof sheets. 
It is very gratifying to have found such a com­
pany to deal with.

Foreword

The present book is intended as a text in basic mathematics. As such, 
it can have multiple use: for a one-year course in the high schools during the 
third or fourth year (if possible the third, so that calculus can be taken 
during the fourth year); for a complementary reference in earlier high school 
grades (elementary algebra and geometry are covered); for a one-semester 
course at the college level, to review or to get a firm foundation in the basic 
mathematics necessary to go ahead in calculus, linear algebra, or other topics.

Years ago, the colleges used to give courses in “ college algebra” and 
other subjects which should have been covered in high school. More recently, 
such courses have been thought unnecessary, but some experiences I have had 
show that they are just as necessary as ever. What is happening is that the 
colleges are getting a wide variety of students from high schools, ranging 
from exceedingly well-prepared ones who have had a good first course in 
calculus, down to very poorly prepared ones. This latter group includes both 
adults who return to college after several years’ absence in order to improve 
their technical education, and students from the high schools who were not 
adequately taught. This is the reason why some material properly belonging 
to the high-school level must still be offered in the colleges.

The topics in this book are covered in such a way as to bring out clearly 
all the important points which are used afterwards in higher mathematics.
I think it is important not to separate arbitrarily in different courses the 
various topics which involve both algebra and geometry. Analytic geometry 
and vector geometry should be considered simultaneously with algebra and 
plane geometry, as natural continuations of these. I think it is much more 
valuable to go into these topics, especially vector geometry, rather than to 
go endlessly into more and more refined results concerning triangles or 
trigonometry, involving more and more complicated technique. A minimum 
of basic techniques must of course be acquired, but it is better to extend these 
techniques by applying them to new situations in which they become

X FOREWORD

motivated, especially when the possible topics are as attractive as vector 
geometry.

In fact, for many years college courses in physics and engineering have 
faced serious drawbacks in scheduling because they need simultaneously 
some calculus and also some vector geometry. It is very unfortunate that the 
most basic operations on vectors are introduced at present only in college. 
They should appear at least as early as the second year of high school. I 
cannot write here a text for elementary geometry (although to some extent 
the parts on intuitive geometry almost constitute such a text), but I hope 
that the present book will provide considerable impetus to lower considerably 
the level at which vectors are introduced. Within some foreseeable future, 
the topics covered in this book should in fact be the standard topics for the 
second year of high school, so that the third and fourth years can be devoted 
to calculus and linear algebra.

If only preparatory material for calculus is needed, many portions of 
this book can be omitted, and attention should be directed to the rules of 
arithmetic, linear equations (Chapter 2), quadratic equations (Chapter 4), 
coordinates (the first three sections of Chapter 8), trigonometry (Chapter 11), 
some analytic geometry (Chapter 12), a simple discussion of functions 
(Chapter 13), and induction (Chapter 16, §1). The other parts of the book 
can be omitted. Of course, the more preparation a student has, the more 
easily he will go through more advanced topics.

“ More preparation” , however, does not mean an accumulation of technical 
material in which the basic ideas of a subject are completely drowned. I am 
always disturbed at seeing endless chains of theorems, most of them of no 
interest, and without any stress on the main points. As a result, students do 
not remember the essential features of the subject. I am fully aware that 
because of the pruning I have done, many will accuse me of not going “ deeply 
enough” into some subjects. I am quite ready to confront them on that. 
Besides, as I prune some technical and inessential parts of one topic, I am 
able to include the essential parts of another topic which would not otherwise 
be covered. For instance, what better practice is there with negative numbers 
than to introduce at once coordinates in the plane as a pair of numbers, and 
then deal with the addition and subtraction of such pairs, componentwise? 
This introduction could be made as early as the fourth grade, using maps as 
a motivation. One could do roughly what I have done here in Chapter 8, §1, 
Chapter 9, §1, and the beginning of Chapter 9, §2 (addition of pairs of numbers, 
and the geometric interpretation in terms of a parallelogram). At such a 
level, one can then leave it at that.

The same remark applies to the study of this book. The above-mentioned 
sections can be covered very early, at the same time that you study numbers

and operations with numbers. They give a very nice geometric flavor to a 
slightly dry algebraic theory.

Generally speaking, I hope to induce teachers to leave well enough alone, 
and to avoid torturing a topic to death. It is easier to advance in one topic 
by going ahead with the more elementary parts of another topic, where the 
first one is applied. The brain much prefers to work that way, rather than to 
concentrate on ugly technical formulas which are obviously unrelated to 
anything except artificial drilling. Of course, some rote drilling is necessary. 
The problem is how to strike a balance. Do not regard some lists of exercises 
as too short. Rather, realize that practice for some notion may come again 
later in conjunction with another notion. Thus practice with square roots 
comes not only in the section where they are defined, but also later when the 
notion of distance between points is discussed, and then in a context where it 
is more interesting to deal with them. The same principle applies throughout 
the book.

The Interlude on logic and mathematical expression can be read also as 
an introduction to the book. Because of various examples I put there, and 
because we are already going through a Foreword, I have chosen to place it 
physically somewhat later. Take a look at it now, and go back to it whenever 
you feel the need for such general discussions. Mainly, I would like to make 
you feel more relaxed in your contact with mathematics than is usually the 
case. I want to stimulate thought, and do away with the general uptight 
feelings which people often have about math. If, for instance, you feel that 
any chapter gets too involved for you, then skip that part until you feel the 
need for it, and look at another part of the book. In many cases, you don’t 
necessarily need an earlier part to understand a later one. In most cases, the 
important thing is to have understood the basic concepts and definitions, to be 
at ease with the simpler computational aspects of these concepts, and then to 
go ahead with a more advanced topic.

This advice also applies to the book as a whole. If you find that there is 
not enough material in this book to occupy you for a whole year, then start 
studying calculus or possibly linear algebra.

The book deals with mathematics on both the manipulative (or computa­
tional) level and the theoretical level. You must realize that a mastery of 
mathematics involves both levels, although your tastes may direct you more 
strongly to one or the other, or both. Here again, you may wish to vary the 
emphasis which you place on them, according to your needs or your taste. 
Be warned that deficiency at either level can ultimately hinder you in your 
work. Independently of need, however, it should be a source of pleasure to 
understand why a mathematical result is true, i.e. to understand its proof as 
well as to understand how to use the result in concrete circumstances.



x ii FOREWORD

Try to rely on yourself, and try to develop a trust in your own judgment. 
There is no “ right” way to do things. Tastes differ, and this book is not 
meant to suppress yours. It is meant to propose some basic mathematical 
topics, according to my taste. If I am successful, you will agree with my 
taste, or you will have developed your own.

Part One 
ALGEBRA





In this part we develop systematically the rules for operations with num­
bers, relations among numbers, and properties of these operations and 
relations: addition, multiplication, inequalities, positivity, square roots, n-th 
roots. We find many of them, like commutativity and associativity, which 
recur frequently in mathematics and apply to other objects. They apply to 
complex numbers, but also to functions or mappings (in this case, commuta­
tivity does not hold in general and it is always an interesting problem to 
determine when it does hold).

Even when we study geometry afterwards, the rules of algebra are still 
used, say to compute areas, lengths, etc., which associate numbers with 
geometric objects. Thus does algebra mix with geometry.

The main point of this chapter is to condition you to have efficient 
reflexes in handling addition, multiplication, and division of numbers. There 
are many rules for these operations, and the extent to which we choose to 
assume some, and prove others from the assumed ones, is determined by 
several factors. We wish to assume those rules which are most basic, and 
assume enough of them so that the proofs of the others are simple. It also 
turns out that those which we do assume occur in many contexts in mathe­
matics, so that whenever we meet a situation where they arise, then we 
already have the training to apply them and use them. Both historical 
experience and personal experience have gone into the selection of these rules 
and the order of the list in which they are given. To some extent, you must 
trust that it is valuable to have fast reflexes when dealing with associativity, 
commutativity, distributivity, cross-multiplication, and the like, if you do 
not have the intuition yourself which makes such trust unnecessary. Further­
more, the long list of the rules governing the above operations should be taken 
in the spirit of a description of how numbers behave.

It may be that you are already reasonably familiar with the operations 
between numbers. In that case, omit the first chapter entirely, and go right

ahead to Chapter 2, or start with the geometry or with the study of coordinates 
in Chapter 7. The whole first part on algebra is much more dry than the rest 
of the book, and it is good to motivate this algebra through geometry. On 
the other hand, your brain should also have quick reflexes when faced with a 
simple problem involving two linear equations or a quadratic equation. 
Hence it is a good idea to have isolated these topics in special sections in the 
book for easy reference.

In organizing the properties of numbers, I have found it best to look 
successively at the integers, rational numbers, and real numbers, at the cost 
of slight repetitions. There are several reasons for this. First, it is a good way 
of learning certain rules and their consequences in a special context (e.g. 
associativity and commutativity in the context of integers), and then observ­
ing that they hold in more general contexts. This sort of thing happens very 
frequently in mathematics. Second, the rational numbers provide a wide class 
of numbers which are used in computations, and the manipulation of fractions 
thus deserves special emphasis. Third, to follow the sequence integers- 
rational numbers-real numbers already plants in your mind a pattern which 
you will encounter again in mathematics. This pattern is related to the exten­
sion of one system of objects to a larger system, in which more equations can 
be solved than in the smaller system. For instance, the equation 2x = 3 can 
be solved in the rational numbers, but not in the integers. The equations 
x2 = 2 or 10x = 2 can be solved in the real numbers but not in the rational 
numbers. Similarly, the equations x2 = — 1, or x2 = —2, or 10x = —3 can 
be solved in the complex numbers but not in the real numbers. It will be 
useful to you to have met the idea of extending mathematical systems at this 
very basic stage because it exhibits features in common with those in more 
advanced contexts.



1 Numbers

gl. THE INTEGERS

The most common numbers are those used for counting, namely the 
numbers

1, 2, 3, 4, ,

which are called the positive integers. Even for counting, we need at least 
one other number, namely,

0 (zero).

For instance, we may wish to count the number of right answers you may 
get on a test for this course, out of a possible 100. If you get 100, then all 
your answers were correct. If you get 0, then no answer was correct.

The positive integers and zero can be represented geometrically on a line, 
in a manner similar to a ruler or a measuring stick:

0 1 2 3 4 ") Fig. 1-1

For this we first have to select a unit of distance, say the inch, and then on 
the line we mark off the inches to the right as in the picture.

For convenience, it is useful to have a name for the positive integers 
together with zero, and we shall call these the natural numbers. Thus 0 
is a natural number, so is 2, and so is 124,521. The natural numbers can be 
used to measure distances, as with the ruler.

By definition, the point represented by 0 is called the origin.
The natural numbers can also be used to measure other things. For 

example, a thermometer is like a ruler which measures temperature. However,

5



6 NUMBERS [1 , §1]

the thermometer shows us that we encounter other types of numbers besides 
the natural numbers, because there may be temperatures which may go below
0. Thus we encounter naturally what we shall call negative integers which 
we call minus 1, minus 2, minus 3, . . . , and which we write as

-1 ,  -2 ,  -3 ,  -4 ,  . . .  .

We represent the negative integers on a line as being on the other side of 0 
from the positive integers, like this:

-4 -3 - 2 - 1 0  l 2 Fig. 1-2

The positive integers, negative integers, and zero all together are called 
the integers. Thus —9, 0, 10, —5 are all integers.

If we view the line as a thermometer, on which a unit of temperature has 
been selected, say the degree Fahrenheit, then each integer represents a certain 
temperature. The negative integers represent temperatures below zero.

Our discussion is already typical of many discussions which will occur in 
this course, concerning mathematical objects and their applicability to 
physical situations. In the present instance, we have the integers as mathe­
matical objects, which are essentially abstract quantities. We also have 
different applications for them, for instance measuring distance or tempera­
tures. These are of course not the only applications. Namely, we can use the 
integers to measure time. We take the origin 0 to represent the year of the 
birth of Christ. Then the positive integers represent years after the birth of 
Christ (called a d  years), while the negative integers can be used to represent 
b c  years. With this convention, we can say that the year —500 is the year 
500 b c .

Adding a positive number, say 7, to another number, means that we 
must move 7 units to the right of the other number. For instance,

5 +  7 = 12.
Seven units to the right of 5 yields 12. On the thermometer, we would of 
course be moving upward instead of right. For instance, if the temperature 
at a given time is 5° and if it goes up by 7°, then the new temperature is 12°.

Observe the very simple rule for addition with 0, namely

Nl.

for any integer a.



[1 , §1] THE INTEGERS 7

What about adding negative numbers? Look at the thermometer again. 
Suppose the temperature at a given time is 10°, and the temperature drops 
by 15°. The new temperature is then —5°, and we can write

10 -  15 = -5 .
Thus —5 is the result of subtracting 15 from 10, or of adding —15 to 10.

In terms of points on a line, adding a negative number, say —3, to another 
number means that we must move 3 units to the left of this other number. 
For example,

5 +  ( -3 )  = 2

because starting with 5 and moving 3 units to the left yields 2. Similarly,
7 +  (_3 ) = 4, and 3 +  ( -5 )  = -2 .

Note that we have
3 +  ( -3 )  = 0  or 5 +  ( -5 )  = 0.

We can also write these equations in the form

( -3 )  + 3  = 0 or ( -5 )  + 5 = 0 .

For instance, if we start 3 units to the left of 0 and move 3 units to the right, 
we get 0. Thus, in general, we have the formulas (by assumption):

N2. a +  ( —a) = 0 and also —a +  a = 0.

In the representation of integers on the line, this means that a and —a lie 
on opposite sides of 0 on that line, as shown on the next picture:

Fig. 1-3

Thus according to this representation we can now write 

3 = - ( - 3 )  or 5 = - ( - 5 ) .  

In these special cases, the pictures are:



8 NUMBERS [1 , §2]

Remark. We use the name

minus a for —a

rather than the words “ negative a”  which have found some currency recently.
I find the words “ negative a”  confusing, because they suggest that —a is a 
negative number. This is not true unless a itself is positive. For instance,

3 = - ( - 3 )
is a positive number, but 3 is equal to —a, where a = — 3, and a is a negative 
number.

Because of the property
a +  ( -a )  = 0,

one also calls —a the additive inverse of a.
The sum and product of integers are also integers, and the next sections 

are devoted to a description of the rules governing addition and multiplication.

§2. RULES FOR ADDITION

Integers follow very simple rules for addition. These are: 
Commutativity. I f  a, b are integers, then

a +  b — 6 +  a.

For instance, we have

3 +  5 = 5 +  3 = 8, 
or in an example with negative numbers, we have

_2  +  5 = 3 =  5 +  ( -2 ) .  
Associativity. If a, b, c are integers, then

(a +  b) +  c = a +  (b +  c).



[1 , §2] RULES FOR ADDITION 9

In view of this, it is unnecessary to use parentheses in such a simple context, 
and we write simply

For instance,

We write simply

cz +  6 +  c.

(3 +  5) +  9 = 8 +  9 = 17,
3 +  (5 +  9) = 3 +  14 = 17.

3 +  5 +  9 = 17.

Associativity also holds with negative numbers. For example,

Also,

( —2 +  5) +  4 = 3 +  4 = 7,
- 2  +  (5 +  4) = - 2  +  9 = 7.

(2 +  ( -5 ) )  +  ( -3 )  = - 3  +  ( -3 )  = -6 ,
2 +  ( - 5  +  ( -3 ) )  = 2 +  ( -8 )  = -6 .

The rules of addition mentioned above will not be proved, but we shall prove 
other rules from them.

To begin with, note that:

N3. If a +  b = 0, then b — —a and a = —b.

To prove this, add —a to both sides of the equation a +  b = 0. We get

—  cz +  cz +  6 = — a +  0 = —c l.

Since —a +  a +  6 = 0 +  6 = 6, we find

b = —a

as desired. Similarly, we find a = — 6. We could also conclude that

— b = —( —a) = a.

As a matter of convention, we shall write

a — b

instead of
a +  ( — 6 ).



10 NUMBERS [1 , §2]

Thus a sum involving three terms may be written in many ways, as follows:

(a -  b) +  c = (a +  ( -6 ) )  +  c 
= a +  ( —6 +  c)
= a +  (c — b)
= (a +  c) — b

and we can also write this sum as

a — b +  c = a +  c — b,

omitting the parentheses. Generally, in taking the sum of integers, we can 
take the sum in any order by applying associativity and commutativity 
repeatedly.

As a special case of N3, for any integer a we have

by associativity 
by commutativity 
by associativity,

N4. a = —( —a).

This is true because

a +  ( -a )  = 0,

and we can apply N3 with b = —a. Remark that this formula is true 
whether a is positive, negative, or 0. If a is positive, then —a is negative. 
If a is negative, then —a is positive. In the geometric representation of 
numbers on the line, a and —a occur symmetrically on the line on opposite 
sides of 0. Of course, we can pile up minus signs and get other relationships, 
like

- 3  = - ( - ( - 3 ) ) ,
or

3 = - ( - 3 )  = - ( - ( - ( - 3 ) ) ) .

Thus when we pile up the minus signs in front of a, we obtain a or —a 
alternatively. For the general formula with the appropriate notation, cf. 
Exercises 5 and 6 of §4.

From our rules of operation we can now prove:

For any integers a, b we have

— (a +  b) = — a +  ( —6)



[1 , §2] RULES FOR ADDITION 11

or, in other words,

N5. — (a +  b) = —a — b.

Proof. Remember that if x , y  are integers, then x = — y  and y  = — x 
mean that x +  y  = 0. Thus to prove our assertion, we must show that

(a -|- b) +  ( —a — 6) = 0 .

But this comes out immediately, namely,

(a +  b) +  ( —a — b) = a +  b — a — b 
= a — a +  b — b 
=  0 +  0 
=  0.

This proves our formula.

Example. We have

— (3 +  5) = - 3  -  5 = -8 ,
— ( — 4 +  5) = - ( - 4 )  -  5 = 4 -  5 = -1 ,

— (3 — 7) = —3 — ( -7 )  = - 3  +  7 = 4 .

You should be very careful when you take the negative of a sum which 
involves itself in negative numbers, taking into account that

— ( —a) = a.

The following rule concerning positive integers is so natural that you 
probably would not even think it worth while to take special notice of it. 
We still state it explicitly.

If  a, b are positive integers, then a +  b is also a positive integer.

For instance, 17 and 45 are positive integers, and their sum, 62, is also a 
positive integer.

We assume this rule concerning positivity. We shall see later that it also 
applies to positive real numbers. From it we can prove:

If  a, b are negative integers, then a +  b is negative.

by associativity 
by commutativity



1 2 NUMBERS [1 , §2]

Proof. We can write a — —n and b = — m, where m, n are positive. 
Therefore

a +  b = —n — m = — (ra +  m), 

which shows that a +  b is negative, because n +  m is positive.

Example. If we have the relationship between three numbers

a +  b = c,

then we can derive other relationships between them. For instance, add —b 
to both sides of this equation. We get

a +  b — b = c — b,

whence a +  0 = c — b, or in other words,

a = c — b.

Similarly, we conclude that

b = c — a.

For instance, if
x +  3 = 5,

then
jc = 5 — 3 = 2 .

If
4 — a = 3, 

then adding a to both sides yields

4 = 3 +  a, 

and subtracting 3 from both sides yields

1 =  a.



If
- 2  -  y  = 5,

then
— l = y  or y  = — 7.

[1 , §2] RULES FOR ADDITION 1 3

EXERCISES

Justify each step, using commutativity and associativity in proving the 
following identities.

1. (a +  b) +  (c +  d) = (a +  d) +  (b +  c)

2. (a +  b) +  (c +  d) = (a +  c) +  (b +  d)

§3. RULES FOR MULTIPLICATION

We can multiply integers, and the product of two integers is again an 
integer. We shall list the rules which apply to multiplication and to its 
relations with addition.

We again have the rules of commutativity  and associativity:

ab = ba and (ab)c = a(6c).

We emphasize that these apply whether a, 6, c are negative, positive, or zero. 
Multiplication is also denoted by a dot. For instance

3 • 7 = 21,
and

(3 • 7) • 4 = 21 • 4 = 84,
3 • (7 - 4) = 3 • 28 = 84.

For any integer a, the rules of multiplication by 1 and 0 are:

N6. la = a and 0 a = 0.

Example. We have

(2a) (36) = 2 (a (36)) 
= 2 (3a) 6 
= (2 . 3)a6 
= 6a6.



[1 , §3] RULES FOR MULTIPLICATION 1 5

In this example we have done something which is frequently useful, namely 
we have moved to one side all the explicit numbers like 2, 3 and put on the 
other side those numbers denoted by a letter like a or b. Using commutativity 
and associativity, we can prove similarly

(5x)(7y) = 35 xy

or, with more factors,
(2a)(36)(5x) = SOabx.

We suggest that you carry out the proof of this equality completely, using 
associativity and commutativity for multiplication.

Finally, we have the rule of distributivity, namely

a{b +  c) = ab +  ac

and also on the other side,

(6 +  c)a = ba +  ca.

These rules will not be proved, but will be used constantly. We shall, however, 
make some comments on them, and prove other rules from them.

First observe that if we just assume distributivity on one side, and 
commutativity, then we can prove distributivity on the other side. Namely, 
assuming distributivity on the left, we have

(6 +  c)a = a(b +  c) = ab +  ac = ba +  ca,

which is the proof of distributivity on the right.

Observe also that our rule Oa = 0 can be proved from the other rules 
concerning multiplication and the properties of addition. We carry out the 
proof as an example. We have

• Oa -I- a = Oa -1- la = (0 l)a = la = a.
Thus

Oa +  a = a.

Adding —a to both sides, we obtain

Oa +  a — a = a — a = 0.



1 6 NUMBERS [1 , §3]

The left-hand side is simply

0a a — cl = Oil -|- 0 = Oa,

so that we obtain Oa = 0, as desired.
We can also prove

N7. ( — l)a = —a.

Proof. We have

( —l)a +  a = ( — l)a +  la = ( — 1 +  l)a = Oa = 0.

By definition, ( — l)a +  a = 0 means that ( — l)a = —a, as was to be shown.

We have

N8. — (ab) = ( —a)b.

Proof. We must show that ( — a)b is the negative of ab. This amounts to 
showing that

ab +  ( —a)b = 0.

But we have by distributivity

ab +  ( —a)b = (a +  ( — a))b = 06 = 0, 

thus proving what we wanted.

Similarly, we leave to the reader the proof that

N9.

Example. We have

— (a6) = a( —6).

Also,

Also,

— (3a) = ( —3)a = 3 (-a ) .

4 (a — 56) = 4a — 206.

- 3  (5a -  76) = -15a +  216.



[1, 53] RULES FOR MULTIPLICATION 17

In each of the above cases, you should indicate specifically each one of the 
rules we have used to derive the desired equality. Again, we emphasize that 
you should be especially careful when working with negative numbers and 
repeated minus signs. This is one of the most frequent sources of error when 
we work with multiplication and addition.

Example. We have

(-2 a ) (36) (4c) = ( -2 )  - 3 • 4a6c 
= — 24a6c.

Similarly,

( — 4*) (530 ( — 3c) = ( —4)5(—3)xyc 
= 60 xyc.

Note that the product of two minus signs gives a plus sign.

Example. We have

( — 1) ( — 1) = I*

To see this, all we have to do is apply our rule

— (a6) = ( —a)6 = a( — 6).

We find
( - l ) ( - l )  = - ( l ( - D )  = - ( - l )  = l.

Example. More generally, for any integers a, 6 we have

N10. ( —a) ( —6) = a6.

We leave the proof as an exercise. From this we see that a product of two 
negative numbers is positive, because if a, 6 are positive and —a, —6 are 
therefore negative, then ( — a) ( — 6) is the positive number a6. For instance,
— 3 and —5 are negative, but

( —3 )(—5) = — (3(—5)) = — ( — (3 • 5)) = 15.

Example. A product of a negative number and a positive number is 
negative. For instance, —4 is negative, 7 is positive, and

( — 4) • 7 = - ( 4 - 7 )  = -28 ,

so that (—4) • 7 is negative.



1 8 NUMBERS [1 , §3]

When we multiply a number with itself several times, it is convenient to 
use a notation to abbreviate this operation. Thus we write

aa = a2, 
aaa = a3, 

aaaa = a4,

and in general if n is a positive integer,
an = aa • • • a (the product is taken n times).

We say that an is the n-th power of a. Thus a2 is the second power of a, 
and a5 is the fifth power of a.

If m, n are positive integers, then

Nil. am+n = aman.

This simply states that if we take the product of a with itself m +  n times, 
then this amounts to taking the product of a with itself m times and 
multiplying this with the product of a with itself n times.

Example
a2 a3 = (aa) (aaa) = a2+s = aaaaa = a5.

Example
(Ax)2 = 4x • 4x = 4 • 4xx = 16x2.

Example
(7x)(2x)(5x) = 1 2 -  5xxx = 70s3.

We have another rule for powers, namely

N12. (am)n = amn.

This means that if we take the product of a with itself m times, and then 
take the product of am with itself n times, then we obtain the product of a 
with itself mn times.

Example. We have
(a 3) 4 =  a 12.



[1 , §3] RULES FOR MULTIPLICATION 1 9

Example. We have

(ab)n = anbn

because

(ab)n = abab -a ft  (product of ab with itself n times)
= aa • • • abb • • • b

Example. We have

(2a3)5 = 25(a3)5 = 32a15.

Example. The population of a city is 300 thousand in 1930, and doubles 
every 20 years. What will be the population after 60 years?

This is a case of applying powers. After 20 years, the population is
2 • 300 thousand. After 40 years, the population is 22 • 300 thousand. After 
60 years, the population is 23 • 300 thousand, which is a correct answer. 
Of course, we can also say that the population will be 2 million 400 thousand.

The following three formulas are used constantly. They are so important 
that they should be thoroughly memorized by reading them out loud and 
repeating them like a poemy to get an aural memory of them.

(a +  ft)2 = a2 +  2ab +  ft2, (a — ft)2 = a2 — 2ab +  ft2,

(a +  6) (a — b) = a2 — ft2.

Proofs. The proofs are carried out by applying repeatedly the rules for 
multiplication. We have:

(a -f" b)2 = (a +  6)(a +  b) = a(a —|— 6) —J— 6(a -1- b)
= aa -|- ab -I- ba -I- bb 
= a2 +  ab +  ab +  b2 
= a2 +  2ab +  ft2,



2 0 NUMBERS [1 , §3]

which proves the first formula.

(a — b)2 = (a — b) (a — b) = a (a — b) — b(a — b)
= aa — ab — ba +  bb 
= a2 — ab — ab +  b2 
= a2 -  2ab +  ft2,

which proves the second formula.

(a +  b)(a — b) = a(a — 6) +  6(a — b)

which proves the third formula.

Example. We have

(2 +  3x)2 = 22 +  2 • 2 • Sx +  (3x)2 
= 4 +  12x +  9x2.

Example. We have

(3 -  4x)2 = 32 -  2 • 3 • 4x +  (4x)2 
= 9 — 24* +  16x2.

Example. We have

( -2 a  +  5b)2 = 4a2 +  2(-2a)(56) +  2562 
= 4a2 -  20a6 +  2562.

Example. We have

(4a -  6) (4a +  6) = (4a)2 -  36 
= 16a2 -  36.

We have discussed so far examples of products of two factors. Of course, 
we can take products of more factors using associativity.

Example. Expand the expression

(2x +  l)(x  -  2)(x +  5) 

as a sum of powers of x multiplied by integers.

= aa — ab +  ba — bb 
= a2 — ab +  ab — b2 
= a2 -  ft2,



[1 , §3] RULES FOR MULTIPLICATION 21

We first multiply the first two factors, and obtain

(2* +  l)(x  -  2) = 2x(x -  2) +  1 (x -  2) 
= 2x2 -  4x +  x -  2 
= 2x2 -  3x -  2.

We now multiply this last expression with x +  5 and obtain

(2* +  l)(x  -  2)(x +  5) = (2x2 -  3x -  2)(x +  5)
= (2x2 -  3x -  2)x +  (2x2 -  3x -  2)5 
= 2x3 — 3x2 — 2x +  10x2 — 15* — 10 
= 2x3 +  7x2 -  17* -  10,

which is the desired answer.

§4. EVEN AND ODD INTEGERS; DIVISIBILITY
We consider the positive integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 , . . . ,  and we shall distinguish 

between two kinds of integers. We call

1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, . . .

the odd integers, and we call

2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, . . .



[1 , §4] EVEN AND ODD INTEGERS; DIVISIBILITY 2 3

the even integers. Thus the odd integers go up by 2 and the even integers 
go up by 2. The odd integers start with 1, and the even integers start with
2. Another way of describing an even integer is to say that it is a positive 
integer which can be written in the form 2n for some positive integer n. 
For instance, we can write

2 = 2 1 ,
4 = 2-2,
6 = 2-3,
8 = 2-4,

and so on. Similarly, an odd integer is an integer which differs from an even 
integer by 1, and thus can be written in the form 2m — 1 for some positive 
integer m. For instance,

1 = 2 1 - 1 ,
3 = 2 • 2 -  1,
5 = 2 3 - 1 ,
7 = 2 * 4  — 1,
9 = 2 • 5 -  1,

and so on. Note that we can also write an odd integer in the form

2n +  1

if we allow n to be a natural number, i.e., allowing n = 0. For instance, we 
have

1 = 2 0  +  1,
3 = 2 1  +  1,
5 = 2 • 2 +  1,
7 = 2 • 3 +  1,
9 = 2 4  +  1,

and so on.

Theorem 1. Let a, b be positive integers.
If a is even and b is even, then a +  b is even.
If a is even and b is oddy then a +  b is odd.
If a is odd and b is even, then a +  b is odd.
I f a is odd and b is odd, then a +  b is even.

Proof. We shall prove the second statement, and leave the others as 
exercises. Assume that a is even and that b is odd. Then we can write

a = 2n and b = 2k +  1



2 4 NUMBERS [1 , §4]

for some positive integer n and some natural number k. Then

a, b — 27i “|“ 2k “I- 1 
= 2(n +  k) -(-1
= 2m +  1 (letting m = n +  k).

This proves that a +  b is odd.
Theorem 2• Let a be a positive integer. If a is even, then a2 is even. If a is 
odd, then a2 is odd.

Proof. Assume that a is even. This means that a = 2n for some positive 
integer n. Then

a2 = 2n • 2n = 2 (2m2) = 2m,

where m = 2m2 is a positive integer. Thus a2 is even.
Next, assume that a is odd, and write a = 2n +  1 for some natural 

number n. Then

a2 = (2  n +  l ) 2 = ( 2 m ) 2 +  2 ( 2 m )1  +  l 2 
= 4m2 +  4m +  1 
=  2  ( 2 m2 +  2 m ) +  1

= 2 ^  +  1 ,  where k = 2 m 2 +  2 m .

Hence a2 is odd, thus proving our theorem.
Corollary• Let a be a positive integer. If  a2 is even, then a is even. If  a2 
is odd, then a is odd.

Proof. This is really only a reformulation of the theorem, taking into 
account ordinary logic. If a2 is even, then a cannot be odd because the square 
of an odd number is odd. If a2 is odd, then a cannot be even because the 
square of an even number is even.

We can generalize the property used to define an even integer. Let d be 
a positive integer and let n be an integer. We shall say that d divides n, or 
that m is divisible by d if we can write

m = dk

for some integer k. Thus an even integer is a positive integer which is 
divisible by 2. According to our definition, the number 9 is divisible by 3 
because

9  =  3 - 3 .



Also, 15 is divisible by 3 because

15 = 3 • 5.

Also, —30 is divisible by 5 because

-3 0  = 5( —6).

Note that every integer is divisible by 1, because we can always write

n = 1 • 7i.

Furthermore, every positive integer is divisible by itself.

§5. RATIONAL NUMBERS

By a rational number we shall mean simply an ordinary fraction, 
that is a quotient

— also written m/n, n

where m, n are integers and n 0. In taking such a quotient m/n, we 
emphasize that we cannot divide by 0, and thus we must always be sure 
that n t* 0. For instance,

1 2  3 5
4 3* 4 ’ 7

are rational numbers. Finite decimals also give us examples of rational 
numbers. For instance,

1 14  ̂ 141
1 4 - 1 0  and 141 - 100 '

Just as we did with the integers, we can represent the rational numbers 
on the line. For instance, J lies one-half of the way between 0 and 1, while



[1 , §5] RATIONAL NUMBERS 2 7

§ lies two-thirds of the way between 0 and 1, as shown on the following 
picture.

The negative rational number — f  lies on the opposite side of 0 at a distance 
| from 0. On the next picture, we have drawn — J and —f.

-2  - 3  _ a  o i 1 f ? 2

Fig. 1-6

There is no unique representation of a rational number as a quotient of 
two integers. For instance, we have

1 2
2 — 4

We can interpret this geometrically on the line. If we cut up the segment 
between 0 and 1 into four equal pieces, and we take two-fourths of them, 
then this is the same as taking one-half of the segment. Picture:

0 i i - 3 i  Fig. 1-7

We need a general rule to determine when two expressions of quotients 
of integers give the same rational numbers. We assume this rule without 
proof. It is stated as follows.

Rule for  cross-multiplying. Let m, n, r, s be integers and assume that
n 5* 0 and s ^  0. Then

— = - if and only if ms = m. n s
The name “ cross-multiplying” comes from our visualization of the rule 

in the following diagram:

Example. We have

because

1 = 2
2 "  4

1 • 4 = 2 • 2.



2 8 NUMBERS [1 , §5]

Also, we have

because

? = —
7 21 

3 • 21 = 9 • 7

(both sides are equal to 63).

We shall make no distinction between an integer m and the rational 
number m/1. Thus we write

mm = m/1 = — •

With this convention, we see that every integer is also a rational number. 
For instance, 3 = 3/1 and —4 = —4/1.

Observe the special case of cross-multiplying when one side is an integer. 
For instance:

2n 6 2n _  _ _  30 _—  -  -  > —  -  6, 2re-30,  n -  - j  -  15

are all equivalent formulations of a relation involving n.
Of course, cross-multiplying also works with negative numbers. For 

instance,
- 4  8 
5 -1 0

because
(_4)(  —10) = 8 - 5

(both sides are equal to 40).

Remark. For the moment, we are dealing with quotients of integers and 
describing how they behave. In the next section we shall deal with multi­
plicative inverses. There, you can see how the rule for cross-multiplication 
can in fact be proved from properties of such an inverse. Some people view 
this proof as the reason why cross-multiplication “works” . However, in 
some contexts, one wants to define the multiplicative inverse by using the 
rule for cross-multiplication. This is the reason for emphasizing it here 
independently.

Cancellation rule fo r  fractions. Let a be a non-zero integer. Letm, n be 
integers, n 0. Then

am _  m 
an n



[1 , §5] RATIONAL NUMBERS 2 9

Proof. To test equality, we apply the rule for cross-multiplying. We 
must verify that

(<am)n = m(an), 

which we see is true by associativity and commutativity.

The examples which we gave are special cases of this cancellation rule. 
For instance

_4  = ( —2)(—4) = _ 8 _
5 ( -2 )5  -1 0

In dealing with quotients of integers which may be negative, it is useful 
to observe that

— m _  m 
n —n

This is proved by cross-multiplying, namely we must verify that
( — m)(— n) = TTiTi,

which we already know is true.
The cancellation rule leads us to use the notion of divisibility already 

mentioned in §4. Indeed, suppose that d is a positive integer and tti, n are 
divisible by d (or as we also say, that d is a com m on divisor of m and ti). 
Then we can write

tti = dr and n = ds 

for some integers r and s, so that
tti dr _ r 
n ds s

We see that our cancellation rule is applicable.

Example. We have
10 2 -5  2
15 “  3 • 5 “  3

because 10 and 15 are both divisible by 5.
We say that a rational number is positive if it can be written in the form 

m'ti, where tti, n are positive integers. Let a be a positive rational number. 
We shall say that a is expressed in lowest form as a fraction

ra = - s
where r, s are positive integers if the only common divisor of r and s is 1.



3 0 NUMBERS [1 , §5]

Theorem 3. Any positive rational number has an expression as a fraction 
in lowest form.

Proof. First write a given positive rational number as a quotient of 
positive integers m/n. We know that 1 is a common divisor of m and n. 
Furthermore, any common divisor is at most equal to m or n. Thus among all 
common divisors there is a greatest one, which we denote by d. Thus we 
can write

m = dr and n = ds 

with positive integers r and s. Our rational number is equal to

m _  dr _  r 
n ds s

All we have to do now is to show that the only common divisor of r and s is
1. Suppose that e is a common divisor which is greater than 1. Then we 
can write

r = ex and s = ey

with positive integers x and y. Hence

m = dr = dex and n = ds = dey.

Therefore de is a common divisor for m and n, and is greater than d since e is 
greater than 1. This is impossible because we assumed that d was the greatest 
common divisor of m and n. Therefore 1 is the only common divisor of r and 
s, and our theorem is proved.

Example. Any positive rational number can be expressed as a quotient 
m/n, where m, n are positive integers which are not both even, because if 
m/n is the expression of this rational number in lowest form, then 2 cannot 
divide both m and n, and therefore at least one of them must be odd.

Let
m . r— andn s

be rational numbers, expressed as quotients of integers. We can put these 
rational numbers over a common denominator ns by writing

m ms , r nr— = —  and -  = — • n ns s ns



[1 , §5] RATIONAL NUMBERS 3 1

For instance, to put 3/5 and 5/7 over the common denominator 5 • 7 = 35, 
we write

3 3 -7  21 , 5 5 -5  25
5

3 -7  21 
F ^ * 3 5  “ d 7*5 35

This leads us to the formula for the addition of rational numbers. 
Consider first a special case, when the rational numbers have a common 
denominator, for instance,

3 8 = 11
5 +  5 5 ‘

This is reasonable just from the interpretation of rational numbers: If we 
have three-fifths of something, and add eight-fifths of that same thing, then 
we get eleven-fifths of that thing. In general, we can write the rule for 
addition when the rational numbers have a common denominator as

Example. We have
- 5  2 - 3
8 +  8 “  8

When the rational numbers do not have a common denominator, we get 
the formula for their addition by putting them over a common denominator. 

m rNamely, let — and -  be rational numbers, expressed as quotients of integers
n s

m, n and r, s with n j* 0 and s j* 0. Then we have seen that
r nr
s ns

m sm— = —  and n sn

Thus our rational numbers now have the common denominator sn, and thus 
the formula for addition in this general case is

Example. We have
7 +  4*5

Using our rule for adding rational numbers, we conclude at once: 

The sum of positive rational numbers is also positive.

Observe that our number 0 has the property that

for any integer n 0. Indeed, applying our test for the equality of two 
fractions, we must verify that

This is easily seen using the analogous property for integers. Namely, write 
a = m/n, where m, n are integers, and n 9* 0. Then

and similarly on the other side.
Let a = m/n be a rational number, where m, n are integers and n 0. 

Then we have

0 1 = 0 • 71,

and this is true because both sides are equal to 0. 
For any rational number a, we have

0 +  a = a +  0 = a.

[1 , §5] RATIONAL NUMBERS 3 3

For this reason, we shall write

— m _  m 
n n

By a previous remark, we also see that

m _  m 
n —n

This shows how a minus sign can be moved around the various terms of a 
fraction without changing the value of the fraction.

A rational number which can be written as a fraction
m _  — m _  m 
n n —n

where m, n are positive integers will be called negative. For example, the 
number

3 - 3  _  3 
- 5  5 “  5

is negative. Using the definition of addition of rational numbers, you can 
easily verify for yourselves that a sum of negative rational numbers is 
negative.

Addition of rational numbers satisfies the properties of commutativity and 
associativity.

Just as we did for integers, the above statement will be accepted without 
proof. It is in fact a general property of much more general numbers, which 
will be restated again for these numbers in the next section.

In §2, we proved a number of properties of addition using only commutativity 
and associativity, together with the rules

0 +  a = a and a +  ( —a) = 0.
These properties therefore remain valid for rational numbers. Similarly, all 
the exercises of §2 remain valid for rational numbers.

This remark will again be made later whenever we meet a similar situation. 
For instance, we see as before that

if a +  b = 0, then b = —a.



34 NUMBERS [1 , §5 ]

We just add —a to both sides of the equation a +  6 = 0. In words, we can 
say: To test whether a given rational number is equal to minus another, all 
we need to verify is that the sum of the numbers is equal to 0.

We shall now give the formula for multiplication of rational numbers. 
This formula is:

m r mr
— • — =  —  •

n s ns

Thus to take the product of two rational numbers, we multiply their numer­
ators and multiply their denominators. More precisely, the numerator of 
the product is the product of the numerators, and the denominator of the 
product is the product of the denominators.

Example. We have
3 7 = 21
5 ’ 8 40 '

Also,
2 11 = 22
7 16 112'

We can write this last fraction in simpler form, namely

2 11 2 • 11 
7 ’ 16 “  7 • 2 • 8 ’

We can then cancel 2 and get

2 11 = 11
7 ’ 16 56 ‘

This shows that sometimes it is best not to carry out a multiplication before 
looking at the possibility of cancellations.

Example. We have

- 4  7 ( -4 )7  -2 8  28
5 ’ - 3  ”  5 (—3) ”  -15  ”  15 ‘

Example. A chemical substance disintegrates in such a way that it gets 
halved every 10 min. If there are 20 grams (g) of the substance present at a 
given time, how much will be left after 50 min?

This is easily done. At the end of 10 min, we have -  • 20 g left. At the
1 2 

end of 20 min, we have — • 20 g left, and so on; at the end of 50 min, we have 
2Z

“  • 20 = —25 v 32

grams left. This is a correct answer. If you want to put the fraction in lowest 
form, you may do so, and then you get the answer in the form f  g. You can 
also put it in approximate decimals, which we don’t do here.

We ask: Is there a positive rational number a whose square is 2? The 
answer is at first not obvious. Such a number would be a square root of 2. 
Note that l 2 = 1 • 1 = 1 and 22 = 4. Thus the square of 1 is smaller than
2 and the square of 2 is bigger than 2. Any positive square root of 2 will 
therefore lie between 1 and 2 if it exists. We could experiment with various 
decimals to see whether they yield a square root of 2. For instance, let us 
try the decimal just in the middle between 1 and 2. We have

(1.5)2 = 2.25,

which is bigger than 2. Thus 1.5 is not a square root of 2, and is too big to 
be one.



3 6 NUMBERS [1 , §5]

We could try more systematically, namely:

(1.1)2 = 1.21 (too small),
(1.2)2 = 1.44 (too small),
(1.3)2 = 1.69 (too small),
(1.4)2 = 1.96 (too small but coming closer).

We know that 1.5 is too big, and hence we must go to the next decimal 
place to try out further.

(1.41)2 = 1.9881 (too small),
(1.42)2 = 2.0164 (too big).

Thus we must go to the next decimal place for further experimentation. 
We try successively (1.411)2, (1.412)2, (1.413)2, (1.414)2 and find that they 
are too small. Computing (1.415)2 we see that it is too big. We could keep 
on going like this. There are several things to be said about our procedure.
(1) It is very systematic, and could be programmed on a computer.
(2) It gives us increasingly good approximations to a square root of 2, 

namely it gives us rational numbers whose squares come closer and closer 
to 2.

However, to find a rational number whose square is 2, the' procedure 
is a bummer because of the following theorem.

Theorem 4. There is no positive rational number whose square is 2.

Proof. Suppose that such a rational number exists. We can write it in 
lowest form m/n by Theorem 3. In particular, not both m and n can be even. 
We have

Consequently, we obtain

m2 = 2 n2,

and therefore m2 is even. By the Corollary of Theorem 2 of §4, we conclude 
that m must be even, and we can therefore write

m = 2k

for some positive integer k. Thus we obtain

m2 = (2k)2 = 4k2 = 2 n2.



[1 , §5] RATIONAL NUMBERS 3 7

We can cancel 2 from both sides of the equation

4k2 = 2n2,

and obtain
n2 = 2k2.

This means that n2 is even, and as before, we conclude that n itself must be 
even. Thus from our original assumption that (m/n)2 = 2 and m/n is in 
lowest form, we have obtained the impossible fact that both m, n are even. 
This means that our original assumption (m/n)2 = 2 cannot be true, and 
concludes the proof of our theorem.

A number which is not rational is called irrational. From Theorem 4, 
we see that if a positive number a exists such that a2 = 2, then a must be 
irrational. We shall discuss this further in the next section dealing with 
real numbers in general.

Multiplication of rational numbers satisfies the same basic rules as 
multiplication of integers. We state these once more:

For any rational number a we have la = a and Oa = 0. Furthermore, 
multiplication is associative, commutative, and distributive with respect to 
addition.

As before, we assume these as properties of numbers. Moreover, we have 
the same remark for multiplication that we did for addition. All the properties 
of §3 which were proved using only the basic ones are therefore also valid 
for rational numbers. Thus the formulas which we had, like

(a +  b)2 = a2 +  2 ab +  b2,

are now seen to be valid for rational numbers as well. All the exercises at the 
end of §3 are valid for rational numbers.

Example. Solve for a in the equation

3a -  1 = 7.

We add 1 to both sides of the equation, and thus obtain

3a = 7 +  1 = 8.

We then divide by 3 and get



3 8 NUMBERS 11, §5]

Example. Solve for x in the equation

2(x -  3) = 7.

To do this, we use distributivity first, and get the equivalent equation

2x — 6 = 7.
Next we find

2x = 7 +  6 = 13,
whence

13* = - •

Of course we could have given other arguments to find the answer. For 
instance, we could first get

7

whence
* - 3 = 2

* = \ +  3-

This is a perfectly correct answer. However, we can also give the answer in 
fraction form. We write 3 = §, and find that

7 , 6  13x = — 4- — = — •2 2 2

Example. Solve for x in the equation

3jly 1  + 4 -  ^

We multiply both sides of the equation by 2 and obtain

3s -  7 +  8 = Ax.

We then add — 3jc to both sides, to get

1 = 4x — 3x = x.

This solves our problem.

§6. MULTIPLICATIVE INVERSES

Rational numbers satisfy one property which is not satisfied by integers, 
namely:

If a is a rational number 0, then there exists a rational number, denoted 
by a“ 1, such that

a~la = aa“ 1 = 1.

Indeed, if a = m/n where m, n are integers 0, then a~l = n/m because
m n _  mn _   ̂
n m mn

We call a-1 the multiplicative inverse of a.

Example. The multiplicative inverse of J is f, or simply 2, because

The multiplicative inverse of § is §. The multiplicative inverse of — f- is — 

Observe that if a and b are rational numbers such that

ab = 1,

then
b = a“ 1.

Proof. We multiply both sides of the relation ab = 1 by a-1, and get

a~lab = a-1 • 1 = a“ 1.

Using associativity on the left, we find

a~lab = 16 = 6,

so that we do find 6 = a“ 1 as desired.

From the existence of an inverse for non-zero rational numbers, we deduce:

If ab = 0, then a = 0 or 6 = 0.

Proof. Suppose a 0. Multiply both sides of the equation ab = 0 by 
a“ 1. We get:

a~lab = 0a“ 1 = 0.

On the other hand, a~lab = 16 = 6, so that we find 6 = 0, as desired.



[1 , §6] MULTIPLICATIVE INVERSES 4 3

We shall use the same notation as for quotients of integers in taking 
quotients of rational numbers. We write

Our rule for cross-multiplication which applied to quotients of integers 
applies as well when we want to cross-multiply rational numbers. We state 
it, and prove it using only the basic properties of addition, multiplication, 
and inverses.

Cross-multiplication. Let a, 6, c, d be rational numbers, and assume that 
b 9̂  0 and d 0.

Proof. Assume that a/b = c/d. We can rewrite this relation in the form

-  or a/b instead of b la or ab x.o

Example. Let a = f  and b = j .  Then

3/4 = 3 / 5\~1 = 3 7 = 21 
5/7 ~ 4\7 /  ' 4 5 '  20

Example. We have

2 +  1 /6  — 4\_1
2 A 3 )

3 / 2\—1 3 3 9

a cIf t = -9  then ad = 6c. b a

If ad = be, then % — -y •6 d

b~la = d~lc.

Multiply both sides by db (which is the same as bd). We obtain

dbb~la = bdd~lc,

so that
da = be

because 66-1a = la = a, and similarly, dd~le = lc = c.



Conversely, assume that ad = be. Multiply both sides by b~ld~l, which 
is equal to d~lb~l. We find:

add~lb~l = d -lb~lbc,

whence
ab~l = d~lc.

This means that a/b = c/d, as desired.

Example. By cross-multiplying, we have 

if and only if
3 = 2 (jc — 1) = 2jc — 2,

which is equivalent to
3 +  2 = 2jc.

Thus we can solve for x, and get x = §.

Example. By cross-multiplying we have

4 +  x

4 4  NUMBERS [1 , §6]

= 5jX
if and only if

R 1 5x4 +  x = 5 - x  = — •2 2

Again by cross-multiplication this is equivalent to

2(4 +  x) = 5s,
or

8 +  2x = 5jc.

Subtracting 2jc from both sides of this equation, we solve for x, and get

8

Cancellation law for  multiplication. Let a be a rational number 0. 

If ab = ac, then b = c.



[1 , §6] MULTIPLICATIVE INVERSES 4 5

Proof. Multiply both sides of the equation ab = ac by a“ 1. We get

a~lab = a_1ac,

whence b = c.

We also have a cancellation law similar to that for quotients of integers. 

If a, b, c, d are rational numbers and a 0, c 0, then

ab b
ac c

This can be verified, for instance, by cross-multiplication, because we have

abc = bac

(using commutativity and associativity).
Thus we can operate with fractions formed with rational numbers much 

as we could operate with fractions formed with integers.

Example. If a/b and c/d are two quotients of rational numbers (and b 0, 
d 0), then we can put them over a “ common denominator” and write

a _  ad c be 
b = bd9 d ~ bd

Example. If x, y, b are rational numbers and 6 ^ 0 ,  then we can add 
quotients in a manner similar to the addition for quotients of integers, 
namely

l  +  l  - b - ' x  +  b -'y

= b~l (x +  y) by distributivity

=  ̂ \î  ~ ky definition.

Combining this with the “ common denominator” procedure of the preceding 
example, we find

This formula is entirely analogous to the formula expressing the sum of two 
rational numbers.



4 6 NUMBERS [1 , §6]

Example. Show that

1 1 = 2x
x — y x +  y x2 -  y 2

To do this, we add the two quotients on the left by our general formula 
which we just derived, and get:

1(* +  y) +  1(* -  y) = x +  y  +  x -  y  = 2x 
(x — y)(x +  y) x2 — y 2 x2 -  y 2 ’

as was to be shown.

Remark. In the preceding example, the quotients l/(x — y) and l/(x +  y) 
make no sense if x — y  = 0 or x +  y  = 0. In such instances, we assume 
tacitly that x and y  are such that x — y  0 and x +  y j* 0. In the sequel 
we shall sometimes omit the explicit mention of such conditions if there is 
no danger of confusion.

Example. Solve for x in the equation

Sx +  1 .
2x~—~b =

We cross-multiply. For 2x — 5 j* 0, i.e. x 7* f , we find the equivalent 
equation

Sx +  1 = 4(2* -  5) = Sx -  20.

Hence
8x -  3x = 1 -  ( -20)  = 1 +  20 = 21.

This yields finally
5x = 21,

whence
21

Example. We give an example from the physical world. Suppose that an 
object is moving along a straight line at constant speed. Let s denote the 
speed, let d denote the distance traveled by the object, and let t denote the 
time taken to travel the distance d. Then in physics one verifies the formula

d = st.



[1, §6] MULTIPLICATIVE INVERSES 47

Of course, we must select units of time and distance before we can associate 
numbers with these. For instance, suppose that the distance traveled is 5 mi, 
and the time taken is \ hr. Then the speed is

s = d/t =  ̂ = 2 -5  mi/hr = 10 mi/hr.
~2 nr

Example. A person takes a trip and drives 8 hr, a distance of 400 mi. His 
average speed is 60 mph on the freeway, and 30 mph when he drives through 
a town. How long did the person drive through towns during his trip?

To solve this, let x be the length of time the person drives through towns. 
Then the length of time the person is on the freeway is 8 — x. The distance 
driven through towns is therefore equal to 30x, and the distance driven on 
freeways is 60(8 — x). Since the total distance driven is 400 mi, we have

30x +  60(8 -  x) = 400.

This is equivalent to the equations

30x +  480 -  60s =  400
and

80 = 30x.

Thus we find
80 8

* “  30 “  3 '

Hence the person spent § hrs driving through towns.

Example. The radiator of a car contains 8 qt of liquid, consisting of water 
and 40% antifreeze. How much should be drained and replaced by antifreeze 
if the resultant mixture should have 90% antifreeze?

Let x be the number of quarts which must be drained. After draining this 
amount, we are left with (8 — x) qt of liquid, of which 40% is antifreeze. 
Thus we are left with

40
i o o ( 8 - * ) q t

of antifreeze. Since we now add x qt of antifreeze, we see that x satisfies



48 NUMBERS [1, §6]

From this we can solve for x, transforming this equation into equivalent 
equations as follows:

This is a correct answer, but if you insist on putting the fraction in lowest 
form, then we can say that 6§ qt should be replaced by antifreeze.

Remark. The above examples, and the exercises, can also be worked using 
two unknowns. Cf. the end of Chapter 2, §1.

2 Linear Equations

§1. EQUATIONS IN TWO UNKNOWNS

Suppose that we are given two equations like

1)
2)

2x +  y  = 1, 
Sx — 2y  =  4.

We wish to solve these equations for x and y . We follow what is known as 
the elimination method. We try to get rid of x, say, so as to obtain only 
one equation in y. We observe that x is multiplied by 2 in the first equation 
and by 3 in the second. We want to multiply each one of these equations by 
a suitable number so that the coefficients of x become the same. Thus we 
multiply the first equation by 3 and the second by 2. We obtain

If we now subtract the second equation from the first, i.e. subtract each side 
of the second equation from the corresponding side of the first, we see that 
:he 6x cancels, and we find:

6x +  3y  =  3, 
6x — 4y =  8.

3y -  ( - 4 y) = 3  — 8,

whence
3y  +  4y = 7y = -5 .

This yields
- 5

53



54 LINEAR EQUATIONS [2, §1]

We can then solve for x, using (1), which gives 2x =  1 — y . Thus

1 1 1

Hence
12 12

* “  2 • 7 -  14 '

Our answer is therefore:

- 5  , 12
y  = —  and *  = j g -

If we want x in lowest form, we can always write x =  y, but y§ is quite 
correct.

As a variation, we could also have eliminated y  first. Thus we multiply 
the first equation by 2, leave the second unchanged, and add the equations. 
We get:

4x +  2y =  2>
3x — 2y  =  4.

Adding yields
4x +  3x =  6.

Thus 7x = 6 and x = y, which is of course the same answer that we found 
above. We could then solve for y  using the first equation, namely,

y = 1 - 2s,

so that
12 7 - 1 2  - 5

y = 1 - 7 7 7

It may happen that a system of linear equations has no solutions. For 
instance the system

(3) 2 * - y - 5 ,
2» -  y  -  7

obviously has no solution. The system

(4) 2 * - y - 5 ,
6x -  3y = 1



51] EQUATIONS IN  TWO UNKNOWNS 55

no solution either. Indeed, any solution of 6x — Sy = 7 is also a 
elution of

2x -  y  =  i ,

iivide the equation by 3), and it is again obvious that no simultaneous 
elution exists for the system of equations (4).

We do not want to overemphasize here the theory determining precisely 
cases when a solution exists and when it does not. It “ usually” exists, 

:nless one has a case essentially like the examples above. Our purposes here 
ire mainly to put you at ease with two simple equations in two unknowns, so 
-jiat you have some simple approach to them. We don’t intend to over- 
:*.irden you or give you any worries about them. On the other hand, you 
nay wish to do Exercises 9 and 10 to get the general criterion indicating when
i solution exists. These exercises make precise our meaning of “ usually” .

When you learn about coordinates, then you will see that the simultaneous 
equations we have been considering represent straight lines, and that finding 
iheir simultaneous solution gives the coordinates of the point of intersection 
:: these lines. If you wish, you may look up coordinates right away, and 
zhe first section of Chapter 12 to see about this.

One final remark. Observe that our elimination procedure actually 
r roves that if x , y  are numbers satisfying the simultaneous equations, then 
-.hey must have the value obtained by the method indicated. Conversely 
ihese values for jc, y  actually are solutions of the equations. This can be 
checked each time explicitly. To prove it in general is easy but requires 
setting up convenient notation and using general letters for the coefficients 
: f the equation. See Exercise 11. Here we don’t want to get bogged down in 
abstraction. Our purpose in this section was simply to teach you a simple 
and efficient way of finding the solutions of a simple system of equations.

Simultaneous equations like the above can be used to solve problems 
which we gave in the context of one variable at the end of Chapter 1. We 
give an example of this.

Example. A person takes a trip and drives 8 hr, a distance of 400 mi. His 
average speed is 60 mph on the freeway, and 30 mph when he drives through 
a town. How long did the person drive through towns during his trip?

To solve this, let x be the length of time driven on freeways, and let y  be 
the length of time driven through towns. Then

* +  y  = 8.



56 LINEAR EQUATIONS [2, §1]

This gives us a first equation. Furthermore, the distance driven on freeways 
is equal to 60jc, and the distance driven through towns is equal to 30y. Hence 
we get a second equation

We can now solve our pair of equations, by multiplying the first by 60 and 
subtracting the second. We get

is our numerical answer, and the person drove § hr through towns. This is 
of course the same answer that we found when working with only one variable.

You may now wish to work out the exercises at the end of Chapter 1, §6 
by means of two unknowns, which may be easier to handle the problems.

Sx +  2y  +  Az = 1,
1 ) +  y  +  2z = 2,

x -  3y +  z = - 1

for x, y, z. We follow the same pattern as before, eliminating successively 
x, y, and then solving for z. We choose the order of elimination so as to make 
it easier on ourselves. Thus adding the second and third equations already 
gets rid of x, so we do this, and get

y - 3 y  +  3z = 2 -  l



58 LINEAR EQUATIONS [2, §2]

or

(2) —2y +  3z = 1.

We go back to (1), and eliminate x from the first two equations. We multiply 
the second by 3 and add it to the first. This yields

2y +  3y +  4z +  6z = 1 +  6
or

(3) 5y +  10z =  7.

Then equations (2) and (3) form a pair of equations in two unknowns which 
can be solved as in the first section of this chapter. We multiply (2) by 5, 
we multiply (3) by 2, and add. This gets rid of y 9 and we obtain

3 Real Numbers

§1. ADDITION AND MULTIPLICATION
The integers and rational numbers are part of a larger system of numbers. 

As we know, the integers and rational numbers correspond to some points 
on the line. The real numbers are those numbers which correspond to all 
points on the line. Another way of describing them is to say that they consist 
of all numbers which have a decimal expansion, possibly infinite. For instance

9.123145 . . .
is a real number. It is a rather long and tedious process to develop the theory 
of the real numbers systematically. Hence we shall first summarize some of 
the algebraic properties which they satisfy, and then, as we go along, if the 
need arises, we shall mention other properties. Unless otherwise specified, 
“ number”  will mean “ real number” .

The sum and product of two numbers are numbers, and they satisfy the 
following properties, similar to those of rational numbers.

Properties o f  addition . Addition is commutative and associative,
meaning that for all real numbers a, b, c we have

a +  b = b +  a and a +  (b +  c) = (a +  b) +  c.

Furthermore, we have
0 +  a = a.

To each real number a there is associated a number denoted by —a such that

a +  ( —a) = 0.

As with integers, or rational numbers, we represent a and —a on opposite 
sides of 0 on the line.

Fig. 3-1

61



62 REAL NUMBERS [3, §1]

The number —a is called the additive inverse of a, as before. We also 
read it as minus a. If b is a number such that a +  b = 0, then we must 
have b = —a, as we see by adding —a to both sides of the equation a +  b = 0. 
This is called the uniqueness o f the additive inverse.

Properties o f  m ultiplication . Multiplication is commutative and asso­
ciative, meaning that for all real numbers a, b9 c we have

ab = ba and a(bc) = (ab)c.

Furthermore, we have

1 a = a and 0 a = 0.

Multiplication is distributive with respect to addition, meaning that 

a(b +  c) = ab +  ac and (b +  c)a = ba +  ca.

So far, these properties are the same as those satisfied by the integers 
and rational numbers. In particular, further properties which were proved 
using only these basic ones are now valid for the real numbers. For instance, we 
recall the important formulas:

(a +  b)2 = a2 +  2 ab +  b2,

(a +  b){a — b)

These are /true if a, b are real numbers because their proofs used only com­
mutativity and associativity.

Existence o f  the m ultiplicative inverse. I f  a is a real number 0. 
then there exists a real number denoted by a~l such that

a~la = aa~l = 1.

As with rational numbers, this number a~l is called the multiplicative 
inverse o f a. Instead of writing a-1 we write 1/a, and

we write a/b instead of b~la or ab~l.

The proofs of properties concerning inverses before depended only on the 
basic ones we have mentioned so far, and are thus applicable to the reâ  
numbers. Thus we have cross-multiplication, cancellation rules, etc. We

(a — b)2 = a2 — 2 ab +  b2y

= a2 -  b2.



have the uniqueness o f  the m ultiplicative inverse. Namely, if

ab = 1,

then multiplying both sides by a~l shows that b = a-1.

E E  = E,

a) Show that addition for E  and I  is associative and commutative. 
Show that jE plays the role of a zero element for addition. What is

b) Show that multiplication for E  and I  is commutative and associative. 
Which of £  or I  behaves like 1? Which behaves like 0 for multiplica­
tion? Show that multiplication is distributive with respect to addition.

Remark. The system consisting of E  and I  gives an example of a system 
’»’ith only two objects satisfying the basic properties of addition and 
multiplication. Thus real numbers are not the only system to satisfy these 
properties.



64 REAL NUMBERS [3, §2]

§2. REAL NUMBERS: POSITIVITY

We have the positive numbers, represented geometrically on the straight 
line by those numbers unequal to 0 and lying to the right of 0. If a is a 
positive number, we write a > 0. We shall list the basic properties of 
positivity from which others will be proved.

POS 1. I f  a, b are positive, so are the product ab and the sum a +  b.

POS 2. I f  a is a real number, then either a is positive, or a =  0, or —a is 
positive, and these possibilities are mutually exclusive.

If a number is not positive and not 0, then we say that this number is 
negative. By POS 2, if a is negative, then —a is positive.

We know already that the number 1 is positive, but this could be proved 
from our two properties, and the basic rules for addition and multiplication. 
It may interest you to see the proof, which runs as follows and is very simple. 
By POS 2, we know that either 1 or — 1 is positive. If 1 is not positive, then
— 1 is positive. By POS 1, it must follow that ( —1)( —1) is positive. But 
this product is equal to 1. Consequently, it must be 1, which is positive 
and not —1.

Using property POS 1, we can now conclude that 1 +  1 = 2 is positive, 
that 2 +  1 = 3 is positive, and so forth. Thus our calling

1, 2, 3, . . .

the positive integers is compatible with our two rules POS 1 and POS 2.
Other basic properties of positivity are easily proved from the two basic 

ones, and are left as exercises (Exercises 1, 2, 3), namely:

I f  a is positive and b is negative, then ab is negative.
I f  a is negative and b is negative, then ab is positive.
I f  a is positive, then 1/a is positive.
I f  a is negative, then 1/a is negative.

One of the properties of real numbers which we assume without proof is 
that every positive real number has a square root. This means:

I f  a > 0, then there exists a number b such that b2 =  a.

Because of this, and Theorem 4, §5 of Chapter 1, we now see that a number 
whose square is 2 is irrational, but exists as a real number.

It is a reasonable question to ask right away how many numbers there 
are whose squares are equal to a given positive number. For instance, what 
are all the real numbers x such that x2 = 2?



[3, §2] REAL n u m b e r s : p o s i t i v i t y 65

This is easily answered. There are precisely two such numbers. One is 
positive, and the other is negative. Let us prove this. Let b2 = 2, and let x 
be any real number such that x2 = 2 also. We have ^

x2 — b2 = 0.

However, the left-hand side factors, and we find

(jc +  6)(jc — b) =  0.

Hence we must have

jc +  6 = 0 or x — 6 = 0

so that
x = — 6 or x = 6.

On the other hand, the square of — 6 is equal to 2, because

( —ft)2 = ( —6) ( —6) = 62 = 2.

Thus we have proved our assertion.
Of the two numbers whose square is 2, we conclude from POS 2 that 

precisely one of them is positive. We now adopt a convention, in force 
throughout all of mathematics. We agree to call the square root of 2 
only the positive number 6 whose square is 2, This positive number will 
be denoted by

V 2.

Therefore the two numbers whose square is 2 are

y /2  and — \ /2,
and we have

V2 > 0.
Exactly the same arguments show that given any positive number a, 

there exist precisely two numbers whose square is a. If 6 is one of them, 
then —6 is the other. Just replace 2 by a in the preceding arguments. Again 
by convention, we let

V a

denote the unique positive number whose square is a. The other number 
whose square is a is therefore —y/a . We shall express this also by saying



66 REAL NUMBERS [3, §2]

that the solutions of the equation x2 = a are

x =  db y/a .

We read this as “ jc equals plus or minus square root of a” .
Another way of putting this is:

I f  y  ore numbers such that x2 = y 2, then x = y  or x = —y.

But we cannot conclude that x = y. Furthermore, for any number x, the 
number

y /x 2

is ^ 0. Thus
V  ( —3)2 = \/9 = 3.

There is a special notation for this. We call y/sP  the absolute value of x, 
and denote it by

|*| = V * 5.

Thus we have

| —3| = 3 and also | —5| = 5.

Of course, for any positive number a, we have

\a\ = a.

Thus
|3| = 3 and |5| = 5.

We won’t work too much with absolute values in this book, and we do 
not want to overemphasize them here. Occasionally, we need the notion, 
and we need to know that the absolute value of —3 is 3. In that spirit, we 
give an example showing how to solve an equation with an absolute value 
ip it, just to drive the definition home, but not to belabor the point.

Example. Find all values of x such that \x +  5| = 2.
To do this, we note that \x +  5| = 2  if and only if x +  5 = 2 or 

x +  5 = —2. Thus we have two possibilities, namely

x =  2 — 5 = —3 and x = —5 — 2 = —7.

This solves our problem.



[3, §2] REAL n u m b e r s : p o s i t i v i t y 67

Observe that
1 _  V 2 

V 2  ~  2 '

This is because
2 =  V 2 V 2 ,

and so our assertion is true because of cross-multiplication. It is a tradition 
in elementary schools to transform a quotient like

1
V 2

into another one in which the square root sign does not appear in the 
denominator. As far as we are concerned, doing this is not particularly useful 
in general. It may be useful in special cases, but neither more nor less than 
other manipulations with quotients, to be determined ad hoc as the need 
arises. Actually, in many cases it is useful to have the square root in the 
denominator. We shall give two examples of how to transform an expression 
involving square roots in the numerator or denominator. The manipulations 
of these examples will be based on the old rule

(x +  y) (x -  y) = x2 -  y 2.

Example. Consider a quotient

2 +  V 5

We wish to express it as a quotient where the denominator is a rational 
number. We multiply both numerator and denominator by

2 -  Vs.
This yields

3 (2 -  V5) = 6 -  3V5 = 6 -  3V5 = _ 6 3v/g 
(2 + V5) (2 -  V5) 22 -  (V5)2 - 1

Example. This example has the same notation as an actual case which 
arises in more advanced courses of calculus. Let x and h be numbers such 
that x and x +  h are positive. We wish to write the quotient

y j  x +  h — y /x
h



68 REAL NUMBERS [3, §2]

in such a way that the square root signs occur only in the denominator. 
We multiply numerator and denominator by {y/x  +  h +  y /x ). We obtain:

(V s  +  h — y /x ) {y /x  +  h +  y /x ) _  (V x  +  ft)2 — (V s )2 
h {y/x  +  h +  y /x ) h {y / x +  h +  y /x )

_  x +  h — x 
h {V x  +  h +  y/x )

= ________ h________
h {y / x +  h +  y/x )

_  1________
V x -f-~h -f- y /x

Thus we find finally:

y /x  +  h — y /x  ________ 1_______
^ y /x  +  h +  y /x

In the first example, the procedure we have followed is called rational­
izing the denominator. In the second example, the procedure is called 
rationalizing the numerator. In a quotient involving square roots, 
rationalizing the numerator means that we transform this quotient into 
another one, equal to the first, but such that no square root sign appears in 
the numerator. Similarly, rationalizing the denominator means that we 
transform this quotient into another one, equal to the first, but such that no 
square root appears in the denominator. Both procedures are useful in 
practice.

Square roots will be used when we discuss the Pythagoras Theorem, 
and the distance between points in Chapter 8, §2. You could very well look 
up these sections right now to see these applications, especially the section 
on distanceN

§3. POWERS AND ROOTS
Let n be a positive integer and let a be a real number. As before, we let

y /  x — 1 = 3 +  y /x .

be the product of a with itself n times. The rule

a m +n  — a ma n

holds as before, if m, n are positive integers.



;3, §3] POWERS AND ROOTS 71

Let a be a positive number and let n be a positive integer. As part of 
the properties of real numbers, we assume, but do not prove, that there exists 
a unique positive real number r such that ^ ^

rn = a.

This number r is called the n -th  root of a, and is denoted by
l/n  ^  n/~a or v a .

The n-th root generalizes the existence and uniqueness of the square root 
discussed in the preceding section.

Theorem  I. Let a, b be positive real numbers. Then

(ab)l,n = al/nbl/n.

Proof. Let r = a1/n and s = bl/n. This means that rn = a and sn = b. 
Therefore

(rs)n = rnsn =  ab.

This means that rs is the n-th root of ab, and proves our theorem.

The n-th root can be further generalized to fractional powers. Let a be 
a positive real number. We shall assume without proof the following property 
of numbers.

Fractional pow ers . Let a be a positive number. To each rational number 
x we can associate a positive number denoted by ax, which is the n-th power 
of a when x is a positive integer n, the n-th root of a when x = l /n,  and 
satisfying the following conditions:

POW 1. For all rational numbers x, y  we have

a x + y  =  a xa y m

POW 2. For all rational numbers x, y  we have

(ax)v = axy.

POW 3. I f a , b  are positive, then

(<ab)x = axbx.

We shall now derive consequences from these conditions.



72 REAL NUMBERS [3, §3]

First, we compute a0. Let 6 = a0. We have:

a = a1 = a0+1 = a°al = a°a. 

Thus a = 6a. Multiply both sides by a-1. We get

1 = aa~l = baa~l = 6. 

Thus we find the important formula

Next we shall see what a negative power is like. Let x be a positive 
rational number. Then

1 = a0 =  az+(-z) = axa~x.

Thus the product of ax and a~x is 1. This means that a~x is the multiplicative 
inverse of az, and thus that

This also justifies our notation, writing a~l for the multiplicative inverse of a. 

Example. Let x = 3. Then
—3 / 3 \ —1 1 

a =  (a ) = ^3 *a6
Similarly,

2—4 = (24) - 1 = ^ -

Thus very roughly speaking, taking negative powers corresponds to taking 
a quotient.

Next, letjT/ = m /n  be a positive rational number, expressed as a quotient 
of positive integers m, n. Then by POW 2, we find:

am/n = (am)1/n = (a1/n)m.

The fractional power can be decomposed into an ordinary power with an 
integer and an ra-th root.



[3, §3] POWERS AND ROOTS 73

Example. We have
8 2/3 =  (8 l/3)2

= 22 = 4.

Example. We have

(V 2)3/4 = (V 21/4)3
=  (21/8)3  _  2 3 /8>

Example. We have

( V 2f  =  V 2 V 2 V 2  ^
= 2 V 2  = 23/2.

Example. We have

/25\3/2 _  253/2 _  125
\ 9 /  ”  93/2 ”  27

We would also like to take powers with irrational exponents, i.e. we would 
like to define numbers like

2V2.

This is much more difficult, but it can be done in such a way that the two 
conditions POW 1 and POW 2 are satisfied. We shall not need this, and 
therefore shall postpone a systematic development for a more advanced course, 
although we shall make some further comments on the situation in the chapter 
on functions. However, we are led to make a final comment concerning the 
real numbers, as distinguished from the rational numbers.

Note that the properties of addition, multiplication, and positivity hold 
for rational numbers. What distinguishes the real numbers from the rationals 
is the existence of more numbers, like square roots, ra-th roots, general 
exponents, etc. To make this “ etc.”  precise is a more complicated under­
taking. We can ask: Is there a neat way (besides stating that the real 
numbers consist of all infinite decimals) of expressing a property of the reals 
which guarantees that any number which we want to exist intuitively can 
be proved to exist using just this property? The answer is yes, but belongs 
to a much more advanced course. Thus throughout this course and through­
out elementary calculus, whenever we wish a real number to exist so that we 
can carry out a certain discussion, our policy is to assume its existence and to 
postpone the proof to more advanced courses.

[3, §4] INEQUALITIES 75

§4. INEQUALITIES
We recall that we write

a > 0

if a is positive. If a, b are two real numbers, we shall write 

a >  b instead of a — b >  0.

We shall write

a <  0 instead of —a > 0  ^
and also

b <  a instead of a >  b.

Example. We have 3 > 2 because 3 — 2 = 1 > 0. We have

- 1  > —2
because

- 1  +  2 = 1 > 0.

In the geometric representation of numbers on the line, the relation 
a >  b means that a lies to the right of b. We see that —1 lies to the right 
of “ 2 in our example.

- 2 - 1  o l 2 Fig. 3-2

We shall write
a ^ b

to mean a is greater than or equal to b. Thus

3 ^ 2  and 3 ^ 3

are both true inequalities.
Using only our two properties POS 1 and POS 2, we shall prove rules 

for dealing with inequalities. In what follows, we let a, 6, c be real numbers.

IN 1. I f  a >  b and b >  c, then a >  c.

IN 2. I f  a >  b and c > 0, then ac >  be.

IN 3. I f  a >  b and c < 0, then ac <  be.



76 REAL NUMBERS [3, §4]

Rule IN 2 expresses the fact that an inequality which is multiplied by a 
positive number is preserved. Rule IN 3 tells us that if we multiply both 
sides of an inequality by a negative number, then the inequality gets reversed. 
For instance, we have the inequality

1 < 3.

But “ 2 is negative, and if we multiply both sides by —2 we get

“ 2 > —6.

This is represented geometrically by the fact that —2 lies to the right of —6 
on the line.

Let us now prove the rules for inequalities.
To prove IN 1, suppose that a >  b and b > c. By definition, this means 

that
a -  b > 0

and
b -  c > 0.

Using property POS 1, we conclude that

a — b +  b — c >  0.

Canceling b gives us
a — c > 0,

which means that a >  c, as was to be shown.
To prove IN 2, suppose that a >  b and c > 0. By definition,

a — 6 > 0.

Hence using POS 1 concerning the product of positive numbers, we conclude 
that

(a — b)c > 0.

The left-hand side of this inequality is equal to ac — be by distributivity. 
Therefore

ac — be > 0,

which means that
ac > 6c,

thus proving IN 2.



[3, §4] INEQUALITIES 77

We shall leave the proof of IN 3 as an exercise.
Other properties which can easily be proved from the three basic ones 

will be left as exercises (see Exercises 2 through 5). They will be used 
constantly without further reference. In particular, we use some of them in 
the next examples.

Example. We wish to show that the inequality

2x -  4 >  5

is equivalent to an inequality of type x >  a or x <  b. Indeed, it is equivalent 
to

2x > 5 +  4 = 9,

which is equivalent to
9

* > 2

Example. Suppose that x is a number such that 

(1) <  2-

We wish to find equivalent conditions under which this is true, expressed by 
simpler inequalities like x >  a or x < 6. Note that the quotient on the left 
makes no sense if x =  4. Thus it is natural to consider the two cases 
separately, x >  4 and x < 4. Suppose that x > 4. Then x — 4 > 0 and 
hence, in this case, our inequality (1) is equivalent to

Sx +  5 < 2{x — 4) = 2x — 8.

This in turn is equivalent to

Sx — 2x < “ 8 — 5

or, in other words,
x < “ 13.

However, in our case x > 4, so that x < —13 is impossible. Hence there is 
no number x >  4 satisfying (1).

Now assume that x < 4. Then x — 4 <  0 and x — 4 is negative. We 
multiply both sides of our inequality (1) by x — 4 and reverse the inequality. 
Thus inequality (1) is equivalent in the present case to

2) 3x +  5 > 2(x — 4) = 2x — 8.



78 REAL NUMBERS [3, §4]

Furthermore, this inequality is equivalent to

(3) 3x -  2x > - 8 - 5  

or, in other words,

(4) jc > -1 3 .

However, in our case, x < 4. Thus in this case, we find that the numbers x 
such that x < 4 and x > —13 are precisely those satisfying inequality (1). 
This achieves what we wanted to do. Note that the preceding two inequalities 
holding simultaneously can be written in the form

-1 3  < x < 4.

The set of numbers x satisfying such inequalities is called an interval. 
The numbers —13 and 4 are called the endpoints of the interval. We can 
represent the interval as in the following figure.

- 1 3  0 4

Fig. 3-3

Example. The set of numbers x such that 3 < x < 7 is an interval, shown 
in the next figure.

Example. The set of numbers x such that 3 ^ x ^ 7 is also called an 
interval. In this case, we include the endpoints, 3 and 7, in the interval. 
The word “ interval” applies to both cases, whether or not we admit the 
endpoints. We represent the interval with the endpoints in the next figure.

o 3 7 Fig. 3-5

In general, let a, b be numbers with a ^ 6. Any one of the following 
sets of numbers is called an interval.

The set of numbers x such that a <  x <  b, called an open interval. 
The set of numbers x such that a ^ x ^ 6, called a closed interval. 
The set of numbers x such that a ^ x <  b.
The set of numbers x such that a <  x ^  b.

The last two intervals are called half open or half closed.



[3, §4] INEQUALITIES 79

Example. Again by convention, it is customary to say that the set of all 
numbers x such that x >  7 is an infinite interval. Similarly, the set of all 
numbers x such that x < —3 is an infinite interval. In general, if a is a 
number, the set of numbers x such that x >  a is an infinite interval, and so 
is the set of numbers x such that x <  a. Again by convention, we may wish 
to include the endpoint. For instance, the set of numbers x such that x ^ 7 
is also called an infinite interval. The set of numbers x such that x ^ — 3 is 
called an infinite interval. We illustrate some of these intervals in the next 
figure.

4 Quadratic Equations

We know how to solve an equation like

3x -  2 = 0.

In such an equation, x appears only in the first power. We shall now consider 
the next most difficult case, when x appears to the second power. We first 
deal with examples.

Example 1. Consider the equation

We wish to solve for x, that is, determine all values for x which satisfy this 
equation. We shall ultimately derive a general formula for this. Before 
deriving the formula, we carry out on this special example the method used 
to derive the general formula.

Solving our equation amounts to solving

We wish to add a number to both sides of this equation so that the left-hand 
side becomes a square, of the form (x — s)2. We know that

(x — s)2 = x2 — 2 sx +  s2.

Thus we need 2s = 3, or s = §. Consequently, adding (§)2 to each side of 
equation (2), we find

(1) x2 — Sx +  1 = 0 .

(2) x2 -  3x =  - 1.

83



84 QUADRATIC EQUATIONS [4;

The left-hand side has been adjusted so that it is a square, namely

*2 ■3*+!= (* ■ I) *
and hence solving this equation amounts to solving

We can now take the square root, and we find that x is a solution if and only i:

Therefore finally we find two possible values for x, namely

This is an abbreviation for the two values

Example 2. We wish to solve the equation
(3) x2 +  2x +  2 = 0.
We apply the same method as before. We must solve

x2 +  2x =  —2.
We add 1 to both sides, so that we are able to express the left-hand side in 
the form

x2 +  2x +  1 = (x +  l ) 2.
Solving equation (3) is equivalent to solving

(x +  l )2 = “ 2 +  1 = - 1.
But a negative real number cannot possibly be a square of a real number 
and we conclude that our equation does not have a solution in real numbers

Example 3. We wish to solve the equation
(4) 2x2 -  Sx -  5 = 0.
This amounts to solving

2x2 -  Sx =  5.
This time, we see that x2 is multiplied by 2. To reduce our problem to on± 
similar to those already considered, we divide the whole equation by 2, ani

solving (4) is equivalent to solving

We can now complete the square on the left as we did before. We need 
to find a number s such that

x2 — | x = x2 — 2sx.

This means that s = Adding s2 to both sides of (5), we find

are the two possible solutions of our equation.

We are now ready to deal with the general case.

Theorem . Let a, b, c be real numbers and a 0. The solutions of the 
quadratic equation

6) ax2 +  bx +  c = 0



86 QUADRATIC EQUATIONS [4]

are given by the formula

provided that b2 — 4ac is positive, or 0. I f  b2 — 4ac is negative, then the 
equation has no solution in the real numbers.

Proof. Solving our equation amounts to solving

ax2 +  bx = —c.

Dividing by a, we see that this is equivalent to solving

(7) 2 . b cX +  -  x ----------
a a

To complete the square on the left, we need

x2 +  -  x = x2 +  2 sx, 
a

and hence s = b/2a. We therefore add s2 = b2/4a2 to both sides of (7), and 
find the equivalent equation

(*+ è) ~ ~i +r
4 a2

_  b — Aojc

4 a2

If b2 — 4ac is negative, then the right-hand side

b2 — 4 ac
4 a2

is negative, and hence cannot be the square of a real number. Thus our 
equation has no real solution. If b2 — 4ac is positive, or 0, then we can take 
the square root, and we find

y /b 2 — 4 acX +  — = zh2 a 2 a

Solving for x now yields

b \ /b 2 — 4 ac 
X 20 ±  2a



[4] QUADRATIC EQUATIONS 87

which can be rewritten as

— b ±  V b 2 — 4ac
x = ---------------------------2 a

This proves our theorem.

Remark. If b2 — 4ac = 0, then we get precisely one solution for the 
quadratic equation, namely

- b  
X ~ 2a ’

If b2 — 4ac > 0, then we get precisely two solutions, namely

— 6 +  V b 2 — 4 ac 
X ~  2a

and
— b — y /b 2 — 4 ac

x =
2 a

The quadratic formula is so important that it should be memorized. 
Read it out loud like a poem, to get an aural memory of it:

“x equals minus b plus or minus square root of b squared minus four ac 
over two a.”

Example 4. Solve the equation

3x2 — 2x +  1 = 0.

We use the formula this time, and get

- ( -2 )  ±  V (—2)2 - 4 - 3x =
2 - 3

4 ±  V ^ 8

In this case, we see that the expression b2 — 4ac under the square root sign 
is negative, and thus our equation has no solution in the real numbers.

Example 5. Solve the equation

2x2 +  3x — 4 = 0.



88 QUADRATIC EQUATIONS [4]

Again, use the formula, to get

- 3  ±  \/9 -  4 - 2 -  ( - 4 )
*  =  2 ^ 2 -------------------------------------

= - 3  ±  V 9  +  32
4

= - 3  ±  V 4 Ï
4

This is our answer, and we get the usual two values for x, namely

- 3  +  V 4 Ï  . - 3  -  V 4 1
x = ----------------  and x = ------------------4 4

Remark. In the proof of our theorem concerning the solutions of the quadra­
tic equation, we needed to operate with addition, multiplication, and square 
roots. If we knew that the real numbers could be extended to a larger system 
of numbers in which these operations were valid, including the possibility of 
taking square roots of negative real numbers, then our formula would be valid 
in this bigger system of numbers, and would again give the solutions of the 
equation in all cases. We shall see in the chapter on complex numbers how 
to get such a system.

EXERCISES
Solve the following equations. If there is no solution in the real numbers- 

say so, and give your reasons why. In each case, however, give the values 
for x which would solve the equation in a larger system of numbers where 
negative numbers have a “ square root” . Use the formula.

1. x2 +  Sx -  2 = 0 2. jc2 — 3jc — 2 = 0
3. jc2 — 4jc +  5 = 0 4. jc2 — 4jc — 5 = 0
5. Sx2 +  2x — 1 = 0 6. 3x2 — 4x +  1 = 0
7. 3x2 +  3x — 4 = 0 8. - 2 x 2 -  5x = 7

9. - 2 x 2 -  5x = - 7  10. 4x2 +  5x = 6



[4] QUADRATIC EQUATIONS 89

11. X2 -  V 2  X +  1 = 0 12. X 2 +  V 2  £ — 1 = 0
13. x2 + 3x -  V 2 = 0 14. x2 -  3x -  V5 = 0

15. x2 — 3x + V5 = 0 16. x2 - 2 x  - V 3  = 0

You will solve more quadratic equations when you do the exercises in 
Chapter 12, finding the intersection of a straight line with a circle, parabola, 
ellipse, or hyperbola.

§1. ON READING BOOKS
This part of the book can really be read at any time. We put it in the 

middle because that’s as good as any place to start reading a book. Very few 
books are meant to be read from beginning to end, and there are many ways 
of reading a book. One of them is to start in the middle, and go simultaneously 
backwards and forward, looking back for the definitions of any terms you 
don’t understand, while going ahead to see applications and motivation, 
which are very hard to put coherently in a systematic development. For 
instance, although we must do algebra first, it is quite appealing to look 
simultaneously at the geometry, in which we use algebraic tools to systematize 
our geometric intuition.

In writing the book, the whole subject has to be organized in a totally 
ordered way, along lines and pages, which is not the way our brain works 
naturally. But it is unavoidable that some topics have to be placed before 
others, even though our brain would like to perceive them simultaneously. 
This simultaneity cannot be achieved in writing, which thus gives a distortion 
of the subject. It is clear, however, that I cannot substitute for you in 
perceiving various sections of this book together. You must do that yourself. 
The book can only help you, and must be organized so that any theorem or 
definition which you need can be easily found.

Another way of reading this book is to start at the beginning, and then 
skip what you find obvious or skip what you find boring, while going ahead to 
further sections which appeal to you more. If you meet some term you don’t 
understand, or if you need some previous theorem to push through the logical 
development of that section, you can look back to the proper reference, 
which now becomes more appealing to you because you need it for something 
which you already find appealing.

94 LOGIC AND MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSIONS [Int., §2]

Finally, you may want to skim through the book rapidly from beginning 
to end, looking just at the statements of theorems, or at the discussions 
between theorems, to get an overall impression of the whole subject. Then 
you can go back to cover the material more systematically.

Any of these ways is quite valid, and which one you follow depends on 
your taste. When you take a course, the material will usually be covered in 
the same order as the book, because that is the safest way to keep going 
logically. Don’t let that prevent you from experimenting with other ways.

§2. LOGIC
We always try to keep clearly in mind what we assume and what we 

prove. By a “ proof”  we mean a sequence of statements each of which is 
either assumed, or follows from the preceding statements by a rule of 
deduction, which is itself assumed. These rules of deduction are essentially 
rules of common sense.

We use “ I f . . . , then” sentences when one statement implies another. 
For instance, we use sentences like:

This is a true statement, patterned after the general sentence structure:

(1) If 2x =  5, then x = -  •
2

If A, then B.

The converse of this statements is given by:

If B 9 then A.

Thus the converse of our assertion (1) is:

(2) If x = - ,  then 2x =  5.
2

We see that the converse is also true.



[Int., §2] LOGIC 95

Whenever we meet such a situation, we can save ourselves space, and 
simply say:

5
(3) 2x = 5 if and only if x = -  •

2
Thus

“ A  only if B ” means “ If A, then B ” .

However, using “ only if”  by itself rather than in the context of “ if and only if” 
always sounds a little awkward. Because of the structure of the English 
language, one has a tendency to interpret 66 A  only if B”  to mean “ if B , then 
A ” . Consequently, we shall never use the phrase “ only if”  by itself, only as 
part of the full phrase “ A if and only if B” .

Example. The assertion: “ If x = — 3, then x2 = 9”  is a true statement. 
Its converse:

“ If x2 = 9, then x = - 3 ”  

is a false statement, because x may be equal to 3. Thus the statement:

“ x2 = 9 if and only if x = - 3 ”

is a false statement.

Example. The statement:

“ If two lines are perpendicular, then they have a point in common” 

is a true statement. Its converse:

“ If two lines have a point in common, then they are perpendicular”  

is a false statement.

Example. The statement:

“ Two circles are congruent if and only if they have the same radius”

is a true statement.

We often give proofs by what is called the “ method of contradiction” . 
We want to prove that a certain statement A  is true. To do this, we suppose 
that A  is false, and then by logical reasoning starting from the supposition 
that A  is false, we arrive at an absurdity, or at a contradiction of a true 
statement. We then conclude that our supposition “ A is false” cannot hold, 
whence A  must be true. An example of this occurred when we proved that



96 LOGIC AND MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSIONS [Int., §2]

\ /2  is not a rational number. We did this by assuming that y /2  is rational, 
then expressing it as a fraction in lowest form, and then showing that in fact, 
both numerator and denominator of this fraction must be even. This contra­
dicted the hypothesis that y /2  could be a fraction, in lowest form, whence we 
concluded that y /2  is not a rational number.

Some assertions are true, some are false, and some are meaningless. 
Sometimes a set of symbols is meaningless because some letters, like x, or a. 
appear without being properly qualified. We give examples of this. When 
we write an equation like 2x = 5, as in (1), the context is supposed to make 
it clear that x denotes a number. However, if there is any chance of doubt. 
this should always be specified. Thus a more adequate formulation of (1 > 
would be:

5
(4) If x is a real number and 2x =  5, then x = -  •

2

Similarly, a more adequate formulation of (2) would be:
5

(5) Let x be a real number. Then 2x = 5 if and only if x = -  •

The symbols
2x = 5

by themselves are called an equation. As it stands, this equation simply 
indicates a possible relationship, but to give it meaning we must say some­
thing more about x. For instance:

a) There exists a number x such that 2x = 5.
b) For all numbers x, we have 2x = 5.
c) There is no number x such that 2x = 5.
d) If x is a real number and 2x = 5, then x <  7.

Of these statements, (a) is true, (b) is false, (c) is false, and (d) is true. We 
can also use the symbols “ 2x = 5” in a context like:

e) Determine all numbers x such that 2x = 5.

This sentence is actually a little ambiguous, because of the word “ determine’\ 
In a sense, the equation itself, 2x = 5, determines such numbers x. We have 
tried to avoid such ambiguities in this book. However, the context of a 
chapter can make the meaning of this sentence clear to us as follows:

f) Express all rational numbers x such that 2x = 5 in the form m/ n. 
where m, n are integers, n 0.



[Int., §2] LOGIC 97

This is what we would understand when faced with sentence (e), or with a 
similar sentence like:

g) Solve for x in the equation 2x = 5.

In writing mathematics, it is essential that complete sentences be used. 
Many mistakes occur because you allow incomplete symbols like

2x = 5

to occur, without the proper qualifications, as in sentences (a), (b), (c), (d), 
(e), (f), (g).

Example. The symbols “x2 = 2”  by themselves are merely an equation. 
The sentence:

“ There exists a rational number x such that x2 = 2.”

is false. The sentence:

“ There exists a real number x such that x2 = 2.”

is true.

Equality

We shall use the word “ equality”  between objects to mean that they are 
the same object. Thus when we write

2 +  3 = 6 — 1,

we mean that the number obtained by adding 2 and 3 is the same number as 
that obtained by subtracting 1 from 6. It is the number 5.

We use the word “ equivalent” in several contexts. First, if A  and B  are 
assertions (which may be true or false), we say that they are equivalent to 
mean:

A  is true if and only if B  is true.

For instance, the following two assertions are equivalent in this sense:

The number x satisfies the equation 2x +  5 = 3 .
The number x is equal to — 1.

We shall use the word “ equivalent”  in other contexts, but will explain 
these as the need arises.



98 LOGIC AND MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSIONS [Int., §2]

We DO NOT USE THE WORD “ EQUALITY” AS IT IS SOME­
TIMES USED, for instance in elementary geometry. The following two 
triangles are not equal:

They are, however, congruent, and under a suitable definition of equivalence 
for triangles, we might even say that they are equivalent. Note that the 
areas of these triangles are equal. In the same vein, the following line segments 
are not equal:

However, their lengths are equal.

The mathematics which we discuss in this book, like most mathematics, 
has many applications and counterparts in the physical world. For instance, 
numbers can be used to measure length, area, speed, density, etc. For clarity, 
we try to use language in such a way that the mathematical notions are not 
usually identified with their physical counterparts. Thus we use words like 
“ correspond” , or “represent” 9 when we wish to associate a physical quantity 
with a mathematical one. In line with this, we can deal with mathematical 
objects on two levels: the purely logical level of axioms, deductions, and 
proofs; and the mixed physical level. Often, it is quite tedious and not 
necessarily illuminating to insist that we follow only the strictly logical 
procedures. It is useful and perhaps more pleasant to follow our physical 
intuition for certain arguments. We shall see examples of both types of 
arguments when we discuss geometry in its intuitive setting and its analytical 
setting.

Fig. 1-2



[Int., §3] SETS AND ELEMENTS 99

§3. SETS AND ELEMENTS
Following mathematical terminology, a collection of objects is called a 

set. The objects in this set are called the elements of the set.
The set of all real numbers is denoted by R. To say:

“ jc is an element of R ”

means the same thing as to say

“x is a real number” .

Let S and T  be sets. We say that S is a subset of T  if every element of
S is also an element of T. For instance:

The set of rational numbers is a subset of the set of real numbers.

The set of integers is a subset of the set of rational numbers.

The set of integers is a subset of the set of rational numbers. It is also a 
subset of R (i.e. a subset of the real numbers).

The set of boys is a subset of the set of all children.

The set of all real numbers x such that 2x +  3 <  5 is a subset of the real 
numbers.

As a matter of convention, we allow a subset of a set S to be all of S. 
Thus any set is a subset of itself. The sentence:

“ For any set S, S is a subset of S”

is a true sentence.

A set is often described by stating the conditions under which something 
is an element of the set. Sometimes we state such conditions so that there 
are no elements in the set.

Example. There is no element in the set of all numbers x which satisfy 
the conditions

x <  0 and x >  0.

There is no element in the set of all positive numbers x which satifsy 
the conditions

2* 1 
i T ~ l  “ d * < 2 '



1 0 0 LOGIC AND MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSIONS [Int., §4]

Whenever this happens, that a set has no elements, we say that the set is 
em pty. Thus the set of numbers x such that 2x >  1 and x <  —3 is empty.

Let S, S' be sets. Often, to prove that S = S', we prove that S is a subset 
of S' and that S' is a subset of S.

Example. Let S be the set of numbers x such that 1 ^ x ^ 2. Let T  be 
the set of all numbers 5x with all x in S. We contend that T  is the set of 
numbers y  with 5 ^ y  ^ 10. First note that if x is in S, then 5x satisfies 
the inequalities

5 ^ 5x ^ 10.

Hence if T ' is the set o f all numbers y  satisfying 5 ^ y  ^ 10, we see that 
T  is contained in T'. Conversely, let y  be a point o f T', i.e. assume that

5 ^ y  ^ 10.

Let x = y / 5. Then x is in S and y = 5x. Hence T ' is contained in T. This 
proves that T  = T'.

§4. INDICES
In a sentence like

“ Let x, y be numbers”

it is a convention of mathematical language to allow the possibility that x = y. 
Similarly, if we say

“ Let P, Q be points in the plane”

we do not exclude the possibility that P  = Q. If we wish to exclude this 
possibility then we say so explicitly. For instance, we would say:

“ Let x, y  be distinct numbers”
or

“ Let x, y  be numbers, x ^ y ”
or

“ Let P, Q be points, such that P Q” .

Similarly, we may wish to speak of several numbers instead of two numbers 
like x, y. Thus we might say

“ Let x, y, z be numbers” ,



[Int., §4] NOTATION 101

without excluding the possibility that some of these numbers may be equal 
to each other. It is clear that we would soon run out of letters of the alphabet 
in enumerating numbers just with letters, and hence we use a notation with 
subscripts, as exemplified in the following sentences.

“ Let xi, X2 be numbers.”

“ Let xi, X2, X3 be numbers.”

“ Let xi, X2, X3, X4 be numbers.”

Finally, in the most general case we have the corresponding sentence:

“ Let xi, . . . , xn be numbers.”

We repeat that in such a sentence, it is possible that xt = Xj for some pair of 
subscripts i, j  such that i j. Such subscripts are also called indices.

Objects indexed by integers from 1 to n (or sometimes from 0 to li) are 
called a sequence of objects or, more precisely, a finite sequence. Thus in a 
finite sequence of numbers, denoted by

{*1, . . . ,  xn}

we associate a number Xj to each integer j  satisfying 1 ^  j ^  n. Thus, con­
sidering a sequence as above amounts to considering a first number xi, a 
second number X2, and so forth, up to an rc-th number x n.

Example. For each integer j  we let xy = ( — I)*'. Then

X i = —1, x2 = 1, x3 = -1 ,  X4 = 1, xn = ( - l ) n.

Observe how in this sequence the numbers xy take on the values 1 or —1.

Example. We shall study polynomials later, and we shall write a polynomial 
in the form

anxn +  an_ixn 1 +  • • • +  ao- 

The sequence of coefficients is the sequence

ill, . . . , •

For instance, the sequence of coefficients of the polynomial

4x3 — 2x2 +  4x — 5 

is the sequence { —5, 4, —2, 4}. We have

ao = —5, a\ — 4, «2 = — 2, <23 =  4.



1 0 2 LOGIC AND MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSIONS [Int., §4]

§5. NOTATION
The notation used in giving an account of a mathematical theory is 

important. It is very useful that the printed page should look appealing 
visually as well as mathematically.

It is also important that notation be fairly consistent, namely that certain 
symbols be used only to denote certain objects. For instance, we use lower 
case letters like a, 6, c, x, y , z to denote numbers. We use capital letters like 
A, By Py Qy Xy Y  to denote mostly points, although we also use A , B , to 
denote angles. When we do that, we reserve P, Q, for points. Within any 
given section, we try not to mix the two. Although one should of course 
always specify what a letter stands for, it is convenient if the use of letters 
follows a pattern, so that one knows at one glance what certain letters 
represent.

Notation can be slick. You will see in the chapters on coordinates that 
the notation of points and vectors is fairly slick. Sometimes, notation can 
be too slick. I hope that this is not the case in those chapters.

We usually reserve letters like /, g9 F , G for functions or mappings. 
We cannot observe complete uniformity in this respect; otherwise, we would 
run out of letters very soon. For instance, we use (a), (b), (c), . . .  to denote 
a sequence of exercises, not numbers.

We use m, n to denote integers, except in cases where they are used as 
abbreviations for words. For instance, m is sometimes used as an abbreviation 
to denote the measure of an angle A, which we write m(A).

In any book, it is impossible to avoid some mistakes, some confusion, 
some incorrectness of language, and some misuse of notation. If you find 
any such things in the present book, then correct them or improve them for 
yourself, or write your own book. This is still the best way to learn a subject, 
aside from teaching it.



Part Two 
INTUITIVE GEOMETRY





This part is concerned with the geometry of the plane. We assume some 
basic properties, which we always try to state explicitly, including properties 
of straight lines, segments, angles, distance, etc. We then prove other facts 
from these.

There are two basic aspects of geometry: the Pythagoras theorem, and 
the notion of congruence. Classical treatments obscure these because of 
undue emphasis on “ constructions” , and ever more complicated diagrams 
involving triangles, parallelograms, etc. I am trying to combat this by 
returning to an exposition based directly on these two aspects. You will see 
how easy some of the usual properties of triangles are to prove, if one starts 
with the Pythagoras theorem. On the other hand, the briefest glance at 
other expositions will convince you how unnatural and complicated plane 
geometry can be otherwise. For instance, the theorem that the shortest 
distance between a point P  and points on a line is given by the perpendicular 
segment becomes obvious from Pythagoras, so obvious that we leave it as an 
exercise.

Taking the Pythagoras theorem and the general properties of isometries 
as our starting point has other advantages: it is precisely this approach which 
fits more advanced mathematics best. It provides an exceedingly nice intro­
duction to mappings. It provides the intuitive basis for the study of per­
pendicularity (and ultimately of orthogonality in vector spaces in subsequent 
courses in linear algebra).

In the next part, we shall indicate systematically how we can give 
algebraic definitions for most of the concepts handled in intuitive geometry, 
and how we can prove the results of geometry using only properties of numbers, 
but in a way which most often parallels exactly the geometric arguments. 
This program involves giving algebraic definitions for points, lines, angles, 
triangles, reflections, dilations, translations, congruence, etc.

105



1 0 6 INTUITIVE GEOMETRY

A proof which is based only on properties of real numbers is called an 
analytic proof. A proof which is based on properties of the plane involving 
our intuition as in Part II is called a geom etric proof.

For the logical development of the subject, it is not absolutely necessary 
to read all of this part. The reader could skip it, and refer to it as needed 
later. But I don’t think it is desirable to inhibit your geometric intuition (as 
a recent trend among some educational schools would do). Don’t be afraid 
of arguing geometrically.

Giving analytic foundations for geometry, however, does not serve 
solely, or even principally, the purpose of making such foundations more 
4‘rigorous” . It provides computational means which are not available in the 
intuitive context. For instance, given two lines which intersect, how do you 
compute their point of intersection? There is little problem if you have an 
analytic definition for a line. If you don’t, the question doesn’t even make 
that much sense. For another example, try to see geometrically why reflec­
tion through an arbitrary point can be obtained as a composite of reflection 
through the origin and a translation (to understand this, read the appropriate 
sections). It isn’t nearly as clear as when you have the analytic definitions 
for translations and reflections given in Chapters 8 and 9. Thus analytic 
foundations for the subject should not be viewed as an invention to make the 
subject arid. Feel free to mix the two approaches— geometric and analytic—to 
get the best feeling for the subject. One reason why the Greeks did not get 
further in their mathematics is that they suffered from the inhibition of using 
numbers to deal with geometric objects. Essentially, mathematics had to 
wait till Descartes to overcome this inhibition. It is equally pointless to fall 
now into the opposite inhibition.



5 Distance and Angles

§1. DISTANCE
The notion of distance is perhaps the most basic one concerning the 

plane.
We shall assume basic properties of distance without proof. We denote 

the distance between points P, Q in the plane by d{P, Q). It is a number, 
which satisfies the following properties.

DIST 1. For any points P, Q, we have d(P, Q) ^ 0. Furthermore, 

d(P, Q) =  0 if and only if P =  Q.

DIST 2. For any points P, Q we have

d ( P , Q) =  d(Q,P).

DIST 3. Let P, Q, M  be points. Then

d ( P , M ) ^  d(P,Q)  +  d(Q,M).

This third property is called the triangle inequality. The reason is 
that it expresses the geometric fact that the length of one side of a triangle 
is at most equal to the sum of the lengths of the other two sides, as illustrated 
in Fig. 5-1.

M

107



108 DISTANCE AND ANGLES [5, §1]

We assume the basic fact that two distinct points P , Q lie on one and 
only one line, denoted by L pq . The portion of this line lying between P  and 
Q is called the line segment between P  and Q, and is denoted by PQ. If 
units of measurement are selected, then the length of this segment is equal 
to the distance d(P,Q).  The straight line and the segment determined by 
P  and Q are illustrated in Fig. 5-2.

Segment between P  and Q Fig. 5-2

We shall assume two facts relating line segments with the notion of distance. 
The first one is:

SEG I. Let P , Q, M  be points. We have

d(P, M)  = d(P, Q) +  d(Q, M )

if and only if Q lies on the segment between P and M .

This property SEG 1 certainly fits our intuition of line segments, and is 
illustrated in Fig. 5-3, where Q lies on the segment P M .

The second fact which we assume is:

SEG 2. Let P, M  be points in the plane, and let d = d(P, M ). I f  c is a 
number such that 0 ^  c ^  dy then there exists a unique point Q 
on the segment P M  such that d(P,Q)  = c.



[5, §1] DISTANCE 109

Again, this property fits our intuition perfectly.

Let r be a positive number, and let P be a point in the plane. We define 
the circle of center P and radius r to be the set of all points Q whose distance 
from P is r. We define the disc of center P and radius r to be the set of all 
points Q whose distance from P is ^ r. The circle and the disc are drawn 
on Fig. 5-4.

Circle Disc Fig. 5-4

Note. In many books you will find that the word “ circle” is used to denote 
both what we call the circle and also the disc. This is not good terminology 
and leads to confusion, because it is always best if a single word is not used 
to denote two different objects or concepts. Geometrically speaking, we see 
that the circle is the boundary of the disc.

Remark. In our preceding discussion, we have made the usual tacit conven­
tion that a unit of length has been fixed. For instance, just to speak of the 
distance between two points as a number, we must have agreed already on a 
unit of distance. Interpreting the distance between P and Q as the length of 
the segment between P and Q again presupposes that such a unit of measure­
ment has been fixed.

A similar remark applies to later discussions, for instance concerning 
area. When a unit of distance is selected, then it determines a unit of area. 
For instance, if our unit of distance is the inch, then the unit area is the square 
inch. We then commit a simplification of language by referring to distance 
or area as numbers. We say that the area of a square of side a is a2. Having 
fixed the unit of measurement as the inch, this means that the length of each 
side is a in., and that the area is a2 in2. For simplicity of language, we agree 
once for all that a unit of measurement is fixed throughout our discussion, 
and then omit the units when speaking of length (distance) or area. Some­
times we also speak of the “ numerical value” of the length, or area, with 
respect to such a choice of units, to emphasize that we are dealing with a 
number. For instance, the numerical value of the area of a square whose 
area is 9 in2 is the number 9.



110 DISTANCE AND ANGLES [5, §2]

We base our discussion of geometry on our concept of the plane. We are 
willing to assume some standard geometric facts, but for the convenience of 
the reader, we have reproved many facts from more basic ones. We assume 
the following facts about straight lines.

Two distinct points P, Q lie on one and only one liney denoted by Lpq. 
Two lines which are not parallel meet in exactly one point. Given a line L 
and a point P, there exists a unique line through P parallel to L. If L\, 
Z/2, i /3 are lines, if L\ is parallel to L2 and L2 is parallel to L3, then L\ is 
parallel to L3.

Given a line L and a point P , there exists a unique line through P perpen­
dicular to L. If Li is perpendicular to L2 and L2 is parallel to L3, then 
Li is perpendicular to L3. IfLi is perpendicular to L2 andL2 is perpendicular 
to L3, then L\ is parallel to L3.

Two points P and Q also determine two rays, one starting from P and 
the other starting from Q, as shown in Fig. 5-5. Each of these rays stops 
at P , but extends infinitely in one direction.

§2. ANGLES

A ray starting from P is simply a half line, consisting of all points on a 
line through P lying to one side of P. The ray starting from P and passing 
through another point Q will be denoted by R p q . If Qf is another point on 
this ray, distinct from P, then of course we have

R p q  =  R p q >.

In other words, a ray is determined by its starting point and by any other 
point on it.

If a ray starts at a point P, we also call P the vertex of the ray.



[5, §2] ANGLES 111

Consider two rays R p q  and R p m  starting from the same point P. These 
rays separate the plane into two regions, as shown in Fig. 5-6.

Each one of these regions will be called an angle determined by the rays. 
Thus the rays Rpq and Rpm determine two angles.
Remark on terminology. There is some divergence in the way an angle is 
defined in other books. For instance, an angle is sometimes defined as the 
union of two rays having a common vertex, rather than the way we have 
defined it. I have chosen a different convention for several reasons. First, 
people do tend to think of one or the other side of the rays when they meet 
two rays like this:

They do not think neutrally. Second, and more importantly, when we want 
to measure angles later, and assign a number to an angle, as when we shall 
say that an angle has 30 degrees, or 270 degrees, adopting the definition of an 
angle as the union of two rays would provide insufficient information for such 
purposes, and we would need to give additional information to determine the 
associated measure. Thus it is just as well to incorporate this information

Fig. 5-7



112 DISTANCE AND ANGLES [5, §2]

in our definition of an angle. Finally, the manner in which the measure of 
an angle will be found will rely on area, and is therefore natural, starting with 
our definition.

If we just draw these rays as shown in Fig. 5-8, like this, without any 
other indication, then we cannot tell which angle is meant, and thus we need 
some additional notation to distinguish one angle from the other, which we 
now describe.

Fig. 5-8

Recall that given a point P and a positive number r, the circle of radius 
r and center P is the collection of all points whose distance from P is equal 
to r.

Let R pq  and Rpm be rays with vertex P. If C is a circle centered at P (of 
positive radius), then our two rays separate the circle into two arcs, as shown 
in Fig. 5-9.

Each arc lies within one of the rjigles, and thus to characterize each angle it 
suffices to draw the corresponding arc. The two parts of Fig. 5-10 thus show 
the usual way in which we draw the two angles formed by the rays.



[5, §2] ANGLES 113

Fig. 5-10

Just knowing the two rays is not enough information to be able to 
distinguish one angle from the other. However, if the rays are given in an 
ordered fashion, selecting one of them as the first and the other as the second, 
then we do have enough information to determine one specific angle. This 
is done as follows.

Let R p q  be the first ray and R p m  the second one. Then one of the angles 
determined by R p q  and R p M  contains the arc going from the first ray to the 
second in the counterclockwise direction. We denote that angle by ZQPM. 
The other angle contains the arc from R p m  to R p q  in the counterclockwise 
direction, and we therefore denote this other angle by ZMPQ. Thus the 
order in which Q, M  occur is very important in this notation. We represent 
the angles ZQPM and ZMPQ by putting a little arrow on the arc, to 
indicate the counterclockwise direction, as in Fig. 5-11.

Angle Z QPM Angle z  MPQ

Fig. 5-11



114 DISTANCE AND ANGLES [5, §2]

Example. If Q, P, M  lie on the same straight line, and Q, M  lie on the 
same ray starting at P , then the angle /.QPM looks like this:

In this case, the arc of a circle between the two rays is just a point, and we 
say that the angle ZQPM is the zero angle.

Note that when we deal with this degenerate case in which the two rays 
coincide, one of the angles is the zero angle but the other angle is the whole 
plane, and is called the full angle. However, with our conventions, we do 
not write this full angle with the notation ZQPM. We do, however, represent 
it by an arrow going all the way around as follows:

Example. Suppose that Q, P , M  lie on the same straight line but that Q 
and M  do not lie on the same ray, that is, Q and M  lie on opposite sides of P 
on the line. Our angle /.QPM looks like this:



[5, §2] ANGLES 115

In this case, we say that the angle /.QPM is a straight angle. Observe 
that we draw the angle ZMPQ with a different arc, namely:

Thus in this case, ZMPQ is different from ZQPM, and both are straight 
angles because the three points P , Q, M  lie on the same straight line.

Given an angle A with vertex P, let D be a disc centered at P. That 
part of the angle which also lies in the disc is called the sector of the disc 
determined by the angle. Picture:

Fig. 5-16

The shaded part represents the sector S.
Just as we used numbers to measure distance, we can now use them to 

measure angles, provided that we select a unit of measurement first. This can 
be done in several ways. Here we discuss the most elementary way (but we 
shall return later to this question, and discuss another unit, which turns out 
to be more convenient in most mathematics).

The unit of measurement which we select here is the degree, such that 
the full angle has 360 degrees. Let A be an angle centered at P and let S be 
the sector determined by A in the disc D centered at P. Let x be a number 
between 0 and 360. We shall say that

A has x degrees



116 DISTANCE AND ANGLES [5, §2;

to mean that
area o f S _  x 
area of D 360

Thus
area of Sx = 360 area of D

In computing the number of degrees in an angle, we do not have to determine 
the area of S or even that of D, only the ratio between the two. We shall 
now give examples.

Example. The straight angle has 180 degrees because it separates the disc 
into two sectors of equal area, as shown in Fig. 5-17.

Example. An angle whose measure is half that of the straight angle is called 
a right angle, and has 90 degrees, as in the Fig. 5-18.

Example. In Fig. 5-19, we have drawn the sectors determined by angles cc 
45 degrees and 30 degrees. The one with 30 degrees has one-third the measure 
of a right angle. In the picture of an angle of 45 degrees, we have drawn 1 
dotted line to suggest the angle of 90 degrees. In the picture of an angle c:  
30 degrees, we have drawn two dotted lines to suggest the angles of 90 degrees



[5, §2] ANGLES 117

and 60 degrees, respectively, showing how the angle of 90 degrees gets divided 
into three parts having equal measures.

Example. In Fig. 5-19 (c) we have drawn the sector lying between the angles 
of 30° and 45°, and inside the circle of radius 2.

We can compute the area of this sector using the definition of degrees. Let 
us assume the fact that the area of the disc of radius r is 7rr2, where 7r is approx­
imately equal to 3.14159 . . . .  (The decimal for 7r can be determined as 
accurately as you wish, but we don’t go into this here.) The area of the disc 
of radius 2 is therefore equal to 4tt. The sector S in Fig. 5-19 (c) has 15° 
(because 15 = 45 — 30), and hence

This is the numerical value of the area, in whatever units we are dealing with. 
You can put this answer into decimal form, using tables for 7r, and a com­
puter, but we prefer to leave it as 7t/6.

Similarly, the area of the sector lying between the angles of 30° and 45°, 
and inside the circle of radius 5, is given by

Fig. 5-19 (cont.)



118 DISTANCE AND ANGLES [5, §2;

We shall abbreviate “ degree” by deg, and also use a small upper circle 
to the right of a number to denote degrees. Thus we write

30 degrees = 30 deg 
= 30°,

or more generally with any number x between 0 and 360, we write

x degrees = x deg 
= x°.

The measure of an angle A will be denoted by m(A). For the moment we 
shall deal with the measure in degrees. Thus to say that an angle A has 
50° means the same thing as

m(A) = 50°.
Remark addressed to those who like to ask questions. In defining the 
number of degrees of an angle, we used a disc D. We did not specify the radius. 
It should be intuitively clear that when we change the disc, and hence the 
sector at the same time, the ratio of their areas remains the same. We shall 
assume this for now, and return to a more thorough discussion of this question 
later when we discuss area, and similar figures.

It is convenient to write inequalities between angles. Let A and B be 
angles. Suppose that A has x degrees and B has y  degrees, where x, y  are 
numbers satisfying

0 ^ x ^ 360
and

0 ^ y  ^ 360.
We shall say that A is smaller than or equal to B if x ^ y. For instance, 
an angle of 37° is smaller than an angle of 52°.

§3. THE PYTHAGORAS THEOREM
Let P, Q, M  be three points in the plane, not on the same line. These 

points determine three line segments, namely

PQ, QM, PM.

The set consisting of these three line seg­
ments is called the triangle determined by 
P, Q, M, and is denoted by

APQM.

Fig. 5-21

Remark on terminology. We adopt here a convention which seems the 
most widespread. However, there is some pervasive ambiguity about the 
notion of a triangle, similar to the ambiguity which we have already men­
tioned about “ circles” . The word “ triangle” is also used to denote the region



[5, §3] THE PYTHAGORAS THEOREM 121

bounded by the three line segments. There is no convenient word like “ disc” 
which I could think of here to serve in a similar capacity. Nobody will 
accept “ trisc” . (Mathematicians have a good time thinking up words like 
that.) “Triangular region”  is the expression that seems the most natural 
to use. There is a mathematical word, “ simplex” , which is used for triangular 
regions and their analogs in higher dimensions (pyramids, tetrahedrons, 
etc.). For this book, we shall be satisfied with “ triangle” as we defined it. 
On the other hand, we shall commit a slight abuse of language, and speak of 
the “area of a triangle” , when we mean the “ area of the triangular region 
bounded by a triangle” . This is current usage, and although slightly incorrect, 
it does not really lead to serious misunderstandings.

Each pair of sides of the triangle determines an angle. We shall say that 
a triangle is a right triangle if one of these angles is a right angle. The 
sides of the triangle which determine this angle are then called the legs of 
the right triangle. A right triangle looks like this. (Fig. 5-22.)

The legs of the right triangle in Fig. 5-22 are the sides PQ and PM.
In our development of geometry, we adopt the following attitude. We 

take for granted certain basic properties about lines (mentioned before), 
perpendicularity, and figures like right triangles and rectangles whose main 
features have to do with perpendicularity. These will be stated as explicitly 
as possible, to make the situation psychologically satisfactory, I hope. We 
then prove properties about other geometric figures from these.

In subsequent sections and chapters of the book, we shall show how 
such foundational materials can be further understood (e.g. by our discussion 
of congruences, and by coordinates).

One basic fact which we take for granted about right triangles is:
RT. If  two right triangles APQM and A P'Q'M' have legs PQ, PM and 

P'Q', P'M', respectively of equal lengths, that is,

length PQ = length P'Q' 
length PM  = length P'M',

then: (a) the corresponding angles of the triangles have equal measure, (b) 
their areas are equal, and (c) the length of QM is equal to the length of 
^ M 7.



122 DISTANCE AND ANGLES [5, §3]

Figure 5-23 illustrates such right triangles as in our axiom RT.

Fig. 5-23

Some of you may already know about the notion of congruence, and if 
you do then you will immediately realize that under the hypotheses of RT. 
the two triangles are congruent. Roughly speaking, this means that you can 
“ move” one over the other so that the corresponding legs lie over each other. 
Later we shall deal formally with the notion of congruence, and develop the 
theory systematically. At this point, we are only concerned with getting 
one basic theorem, the Pythagoras Theorem, and we don’t want to burden 
ourselves with a whole theory just to get to it, especially since our axiom RT 
is psychologically very satisfactory (to me, and I hope to you). We sum­
marized in RT just what we need for our immediate purposes.

The choice of what is assumed in a theory and what is “ proved” depends 
on many requirements. In a subject like geometry, what we assume must in 
some sense be intuitively obvious. We do not wish to assume so much tha: 
we feel uncomfortable about it, and feel that we have really cheated on the 
theory. On the other hand, we do not wish to assume so little that it becomes 
very difficult or involved to prove statements which our mind perceives a: 
once as “ obvious” . We wish to minimize the basic assumptions, and tc 
maximize what we can deduce easily from them. If our system of assumptions 
is very small, and corresponds to geometric properties which we regard as 
“ obvious” , and if we can then deduce easily and fast many properties which 
we do not regard as “ obvious” , then we have gone a long way towards finding 
a satisfactory set of assumptions. If I didn’t think that the choice I have 
made about this was reasonably successful, I wouldn’t have written a 
book . . . .  In addition to that, however, experience with more advance! 
topics shows that the notion of perpendicularity is all-pervasive in mathe­
matics, and that it turns out to be always worth while to have taken it as a 
fundamental notion, and to have taken as axioms some of its basic properties.



[5, §3] THE PYTHAGORAS THEOREM 123

We shall see how some properties of triangles can be reduced to properties 
of rectangles.

Before defining rectangles, we mention explicitly a property relating 
parallel lines and distance. Let L, L f be parallel lines, and let P, Q be points 
on L. Let K P be the line perpendicular to L  passing through P, and let P' 
be the intersection of Kp  with £/. Similarly, let K q be the line through Q 
perpendicular to L, and let Q' be the intersection of K q with L'. We shall 
assume:

PD. The lengths of the segments PP ' and QQf are the same. In other words,

d{P, P') = d(Q, Q').

This is illustrated by Fig. 5-24(a). We may call this length the distance 
between the two lines.

Fig. 5-24

Suppose now that P, Q, M, N  are four points, such that the segments 
PQ, QN, NM , and MP  form a four-sided figure. Suppose that the opposite 
sides PQ, NM  are parallel, and also the opposite sides QN, MP  are parallel; 
suppose also that the adjacent sides are perpendicular, that is: PQ, QN are 
perpendicular and NM, MP  are perpendicular. Then we shall call the set 
consisting of the four segments

PQ, QN, NM, ~MP

the rectangle determined by P, Q, N, M . This rectangle is illustrated in 
Fig. 5-24 (b). Observe that according to our property PD, it follows that the 
opposite sides of the rectangle have the same length.



124 DISTANCE AND ANGLES [5, §3]

If a, b are the lengths of the sides of the rectangle, then we assume that the 
area of the rectangle is equal to ab. (Comment: We are committing here the 
same abuse of language by speaking of the area of the rectangle that we did 
with triangles. We mean, of course, the area of the region bounded by the 
rectangle.) As usual, a square is a rectangle all of whose sides have the same 
length. If this length is equal to a, then the area of the square is a2.

We are interested in the area of a right triangle. Consider a right triangle 
AQPM such that Z.MPQ is its right angle, as shown in Fig. 5-25. Then the 
segments PQ and PM  are perpendicular. We let N  be the point of intersection 
of the line through M  parallel to PQ, and the line through Q perpendicular 
to PQ. Then N  is the fourth corner of the rectangle whose three other corners 
are Q, P, M. Then the sides QN and PM  have equal lengths. The sides QP 
and NM  have equal lengths.

P  Fig. 5-25

Let A, B be the angles of the right triangle, other than the right angle, 
as shown in Fig. 5-25. It follows from RT that Z.NQM has the same measure 
as B. Since ZNQP is a right angle, and since A and ZNQM together form 
this right angle Z.NQP, it follows that:

Theorem 1. If A, B are the angles of a right triangle other than the righ: 
angle, then

m{A) +  m(B) = 90°.

Let a, b be the lengths of the sides of the rectangle. Then a, b are als: 
the lengths of the legs of the right triangle A MPQ. We assumed that tbc 
area of the rectangle is equal to ab. Again by RT, we conclude that the tw: 
triangles A QPM and A QNM which form this rectangle have the same area



[5, §3] THE PYTHAGORAS THEOREM 125

Hence we find:

Theorem 2 . The area of a right triangle whose legs have lengths a, 6, is 
equal to

ab
2

The third side of a right triangle, which is not one of the legs, is called 
the hypotenuse. The next theorem gives us the relation between the length 
of the hypotenuse and the lengths of the other two sides.

Pythagoras Theorem . Let a, b be the lengths of the two legs of a right 
triangle, and let c be the length of the hypotenuse. Then

a 2 +  b2 = c2#

Proof. Let us draw the right triangle with the leg of length a horizontally 
as shown in Fig. 5-26. Let the triangle be A PQM, with right angle at P , as 
shown. Let Pi be the point on the line through P, M  at a distance b from M

Fig. 5-26

and distance a +  b from P. We draw the segment P 1P2, perpendicular to 
PPi, on the same side of PPi as the triangle, and of length a +  6. We then 
draw the other two sides of the square whose sides have length a +  b, as 
shown. The point Pi is the vertex of a right angle, and we can form a right 
triangle one of whose legs is the segment MP\, of length 6, and the other leg 
is the vertical segment P\M\ of length a. We can now repeat this construction, 
forming a third right triangle A M 1P2M 2, and then a fourth right triangle 
AM 2P3Q. Each one of these right triangles has legs of lengths a and 6, 
respectively. Consequently, by RT, the sides of the four-sided figure inside



126 DISTANCE AND ANGLES [5, §3;

the big square have the same length, equal to c. Let A , B be the angles of our 
right triangle other than the right angle. Let C be any one of the angles of 
the four-sided figure, say ZMiMQ. By RT we know that has
the same measure as A , and therefore

m(B) +  m(C) +  m(A) = 180°.

But we have by Theorem 1,

m(A) +  m(B) = 90°,

so that m(C) = 90°. Hence the four-sided figure inside the big square is a 
square, whose sides have length c.

We now compute areas. The area of the big square is

(a +  6)2 = a2 +  2ab +  ft2.

This area is equal to the sum of the areas of the four triangles, and the area 
of the square whose sides have length c. Thus it is also equal to

06 ab ab ab 2  ̂ . . 2

This yields 

whence

2 + ~2+  ~2 + ~2 + C  =2ab +  c •

a2 +  2ab +  b2 = 2ab +  c2, 

a2 +  b2 = c2,

and the theorem is proved.

Example. The length of the diagonal of a square whose sides have length 1. 
as in Fig. 5-27(a), is equal to

V 1 2 +  12 = V 2.

The length of the diagonal of a rectangle whose sides have lengths 3 and 4. 
as in Fig. 5-27(b), is equal to

V 32 +  42 = \/9 +  16 
= V25 = 5.

(a) 0 ) Fig. 5-27

Example. One leg of a right triangle has length 10 in., and the hypotenuse 
has length 15 in. What is the length of the other side?

This is easily done. Let b be this length. Then by Pythagoras, we get

102 +  b2 = 152,
whence

b2 = 152 -  102
= 225 -  100 = 125.

Hence b = Vl25.

Let P, Q be distinct points in the plane. We recall that the perpendicular 
bisector of the segment PQ is the line perpendicular to PQ passing through 
the point which lies on PQ, halfway between P and Q. Observe that if O 
is any point on the line passing through P and Q which is such that

d{0,P)  = d(0,Q),

then O is necessarily on the segment between P and Q. Proof: If this were 
not the case, then either P would be on the segment OQ or Q would be on 
the segment OP (draw the picture). Say P is on the segment OQ. Then

d(0,P)  +d (P ,Q )  = d(0,Q),

whence d(P, Q) = 0 and P = Q, contrary to our assumption that P and Q 
are distinct. The case when Q might be on the segment OP is proved 
similarly.

The next result is an important consequence of the Pythagoras theorem.



128 DISTANCE AND ANGLES [5, §3]

Corollary. Let P , Q be distinct points in the plane. Let M be also a point 
in the plane. We have

d(P, M) = d(Q, M)

// and only if M  lies on the perpendicular bisector of PQ.

Proof. Let L be the line passing through P , Q and let K  be the line perpen­
dicular to Ly passing through M. Let 0  be the point of intersection of K  and 
L. In Fig. 5-28(a), we show the case when K  is the perpendicular bisector of 
PQ, and in Fig. 5-28 (b) we show the case when it is not.

Assume first that d (P 9 M) = d(Q9 M). By Pythagoras, we have

d(Py 0)2 +  d(Oy M )2 =  d(Py M ) 2 

= d(Qy M ) 2 

= d(Qy 0 ) 2 +  d(Oy M)2.
It follows that

d ( P y O ) 2  =  d ( Q y O ) 2 y

whence d (P 9 O) =  d(Qy O), and M  is on the perpendicular bisector of PQ. 
Conversely, assume that d (P 90 ) = d(Qf O). Similar steps show that

d (P 9 M) =  d(Q9 M )9

thus proving our corollary.

elementary geometry. They are used very commonly. We refer to the 
following figures.

O lies on the perpendicular bisector of PM. Thus the perpendicular 
bisectors of the sides of the triangle meet in a point.

§1. SOME STANDARD MAPPINGS OF THE PLANE
We need to define the notion of congruence. For instance, given two discs 

of the same radius as in Fig. 6-1, we want to say that they are congruent.

Fig. 6-1

Similarly, given two triangles as in Fig. 
congruent.

that they are6-2, we also want to say

133

Fig. 6-2



134 ISOMETRIES [6, §1]

Roughly speaking, this means that one figure can be laid over the other. 
To discuss the notion of congruence properly, it is convenient to define 
first a slightly more general notion, namely isometry. To do that, we must 
define still a more general notion, namely mapping. All these notions are 
quite common, and you will see that they include, as special cases, things 
which you can easily visualize, like reflections, rotations, stretching, etc., 
given as examples. We discuss these first, and then take up congruences in 
the last section.

By a mapping (or a map) of the plane into itself, we shall mean an 
association, which to each point of the plane associates another point of the 
plane. If P is a point and P' is the point associated with P by the mapping, 
then we denote this by the special arrow

P'.

The point P' associated with P is called the value of the mapping at P. 
We also say that P' corresponds to P under the mapping, or that P is 
mapped on P'.

Just as we used letters to denote numbers, it is useful to use letters to 
denote mappings. Thus if F  is a mapping of the plane into itself, we denote 
the value of F at P by the symbols

F(P).

We shall also say that the value F(P) of F  at P is the image of P under 
F . If F(P) = P', then we also say that F  maps P on P'.

By definition, if F, G are mappings of the plane into itself, we have

F = G

if and only if, for every point P,

F(P) = G(P).

In other words, a map F  is equal to a map G if and only if F  and G have the 
same value at every point P.

Constant mapping
Let O be a given point in the plane. To each point P we associate this 

given point O. Then we obtain a mapping, and O is the value of the mapping 
at every point P. We say that this mapping is constant, and that O is its 
constant value.



[6, §1] SOME STANDARD MAPPINGS 135

Identity
To each point P we associate P itself. This is a rather simple mapping, 

which is called the identity, and is denoted by /.  Thus we have

HP) = P

for every point P.

Reflection through a line
Let L be a line. If P is any point, let

L' = Lp

be the line through P perpendicular to L. Let O be the point of intersection 
of L and L'. Let P' be the point on L' which is at the same distance from 
O as P, but in the opposite direction. The association

Pi-> P'

is called reflection through L, and could be denoted by Rl. Picture:

Reflection through a point
Let O be a given point of the plane. To each point P of the plane we 

associate the point Pf lying on the line passing through P and O, on the other 
side of O from P, and at the same distance from O as P . This mapping is



136 ISOMETRIES [6, §1:

called the reflection through O. Picture:

p

We have drawn a point P and its value P f under the mapping, and also a 
point Q and its value Q' under the mapping.

For instance, we may reflect the four comers of a rectangle through the 
midpoint O of the rectangle. Each comer is mapped on the opposite corner, 
as in Fig. 6-5.

What happens to the sides of the rectangle when we reflect them through O' 
Figure it out, and then look ahead at Theorem 1 of §2.

Dilations, or stretching
Let O be a given point of the plane. To each point P of the plane we 

associate the point Pr lying on the ray R op , with vertex O, passing through 
P , at a distance from O equal to twice that of P from O. The point P ' ir 
this case is also denoted by 2P. Picture:

^ ------P ' =  2 P

<T Fig. 6-6



[6, §1] SOME STANDARD MAPPINGS 137

This particular mapping is called dilation by 2, or stretching by 2, relative 
to O. According to our notation, if F is dilation by 2, relative to O, then we 
have

F(P) = 2P.

Let r be any positive number. We can of course define the dilation by r 
just as we define dilation by 2, relative to a given point O. Namely, we define 
dilation by r to be the mapping Fr such that for any point P the value 
Fr(P) is the point on the ray with vertex O, passing through P , at a distance 
from O equal to r times the distance between O and P. It is convenient to 
write rP instead of Fr(P).

In Fig. 6-7 (a) we have drawn the points

Q and F3(Q).

In Fig. 6-7 (b) we have drawn the points

P, Fi/s(P), F2/z(P).

Fig. 6-7

A dilation is also sometimes called a similarity transformation, but 
the word dilation is the shortest and best term to be used to denote the 
concept.

Rotation
Let O be a given point in the plane, and let A be an angle. Let P be a 

roint at distance d from O. Let C be the circle of radius d centered at O. 
Let P' be the point on this circle such that the angle Z POP' has the same 
number of degrees as A. The mapping which associates P' to P is called 
rotation (counterclockwise) by A, with respect to O, or relative to O. If

(a)



138 ISOMETRIES [6, §1;

we denote this mapping by Ga, then we can illustrate it on Fig. 6-8 (a . 
where we have drawn O, P, and Ga(P).

(a) (b)

Fig. 6-8

Unless otherwise specified, a rotation by an angle A will always mean counter­
clockwise rotation. Of course, we can also define clockwise rotation by A . 
which we denote by G -a. It associates with each point P the point P" at the 
same distance from O as P, and such that the angle

Z PnOP

has the same measure as A, as on Fig. 6-8 (b).
Observe that a given angle A is not necessarily the same angle as tha: 

formed by
A POP'

(cf. Fig. 6-9) even though they have the same measure. However, experience 
shows that it is harmless for this type of discussion to indicate Z POP' as the

Fig. 6-9

angle A, and it is often convenient to do this to suggest what’s going on. Still 
it is not always harmless to do this. For instance, in a triangle like that ir



[6, §1] SOME STANDARD MAPPINGS 139

Fig. 6-10 where the two bottom angles A and B have equal measures, we 
would not think of denoting them by the same letter.

Observe that rotation by 180° with respect to O is none other than 
reflection through O. Thus if R denotes a reflection through O, we have

Gi80° = R>
We also have

G_iso0 = R>

because the values of each one of these mappings at a point P is the same 
point P'. Even though these mappings are described by conditions which 
appear different, the mappings are nevertheless equal. Recall that, by 
definition, mappings F, G are equal if and only if

F(P) = G(P)

for all points P.
It is convenient to associate a rotation with a number rather than an 

angle. If x is a number between 0 and 360, we let

Gx

be the rotation by an angle of x degrees. Observe that

Go = Gseo = I

is none other than the identity. (To be absolutely correct, we should also 
indicate the point O in our notation, but throughout our discussion we deal 
with the same given point, and thus omit it. If we wanted to indicate it 
explicitly, we could write for instance

Go,x

for the rotation by an angle of x degrees relative to the given point O.)



140 ISOMETRIES [6, §1]

Let x be an arbitrary number. We write x in the form

x = 360n +  w,

where n is an integer, and w is a number such that 0 ^ w < 360. We define 
Gx to be

Gx =  Gw.

Example. Let x = 500. We write

500 = 360 +  140.

Then by definition
Gx =  Gi40

is rotation by 140°.

Example. Let x = —210. We write

-210 = -360 +  150.

Then
G—210  =  G150

is rotation by 150°.

Example. If x and y  are numbers such that

x = y  +  360m

for some integer m, then

GX =  Gy.

Namely, if x = 360ra +  w with some integer n, and 0 ^ w < 360, then

y  +  360m = 360n +  w,

and hence
y  = 360 (/z — m) +  w.

According to our definition, we have

GX =  GW = Gy.

We can interpret counterclockwise rotation by a negative number as 
clockwise rotation by a positive number.



[6, §1] SOME STANDARD MAPPINGS 141

Example. Let x = —90. Then

-9 0  = -360 +  270.
Thus

G _90 = G2 70-

We visualize this as saying that clockwise rotation by 90° is the same as 
counterclockwise rotation by 270°.

We shall use the convention of saying that the rotation Gx is rotation by 
x degrees, or even by an angle of x degrees, even though x may be greater 
than 360, or may be negative. This is convenient language, and reflects our 
geometric intuition without leading to great confusion.

Translations
Let us select a direction in the plane, and a distance d. We can represent 

these by an arrow as in Fig. 6-11. The arrow is simply an ordered pair of 
points (O, M), where O is its beginning point and M  is its end point.

The arrow points in the given direction, and the length of the arrow is equal 
to our given distance. To each point P, we associate the point P' which is at 
a distance d from P in the given direction. This is a mapping, which is called 
the translation (determined by the given direction and the given distance). 
In Fig. 6-12, letting T be this translation, we have drawn two points P, Q 
and their images under T.

Observe that if T = T 0m , then T{0 ) = M, and that T0o is the identity.

Example. Let Tt be the translation by one inch to the left, Tr the transla­
tion by one inch to the right, and similarly Tu and Td the translations by one 
inch upward and one inch downward respectively.

In Fig. 6-13 we have drawn a flower and its translations by Ti, TV, 
Td and Tu.

or just make an approximate estimate of the position of this image.

§2. ISOMETRIES
Let F be a mapping of the plane into itself. We say that F preserves dis­

tances, or is distance preserving, if and only if for every pair of points P, Q 
in the plane, the distance between P and Q is the same as the distance between 
F(P) and F(Q). Such a mapping is also called an isometry. (“ Iso” means 
same, and “metry” means measure. It is useful to have one word instead of 
two for this notion.)

Example. The constant mapping which to each point P associates a given 
point O is not an isometry. Dilation by 2 is not an isometry. Why?

Example. Let F be any one of the following maps.
Reflection through a point 
Reflection through a line 
Rotation 
Translation

Then F is an isometry.



144 ISOMETRIES [6, §2;

This will be assumed without proof. Later when we give definitions for 
these mappings depending on coordinates, we shall be able to prove that 
these maps are isometries very simply. In §5 we shall prove that any isometry 
can be obtained by simple combinations of the examples given above, in a 
sense which will be made precise.

Remark. Let F be an isometry. If P, Q are distinct points, then F(P 
and F(Q) must be distinct, because the distance between P and Q is not 0. 
and hence the distance between F(P) and F(Q) cannot be 0 either. Cf. prop­
erty DIST 1 of distances.

Let S be a set of points in the plane and let F be a mapping of the plane 
into itself. The set of points consisting of all points F(P), for all P in S, is 
called the image o f S under F, and is denoted by F(S).

Example. Let F be the reflection through a line L. Let S be the line segmen: 
between two points P and Q. Then the image of S under F is the line segmen: 
between F(P) and F(Q). Picture:

With our notation, we have

F(PQ) = F(P)F(Q).

The preceding example is but a special case of a general property o: 
isometries, which we state in the next theorem.

Theorem 1. Let F be an isometry. The image of a line segment under F 
is a line segment. In fact, the image of the line segment PQ under F is the 
line segment between F(P) and F(Q).



[6, §2] ISOMETRIES 145

Proof. (See Fig. 6-16.) Let X  be a point on PQ. For simplicity we 
denote F(X) by X Since F  preserves distances, we know that

d(P, X) = d(P', X '), rf (X, Q) = rf (X', Q').

By SEG 1, we have

d{PyQ) = rf(P,X) +  d(X,Q).

By assumption on F, we have

d(P',Q ') = rf(P ',X ') +  d(X',Q ').

Again by SEG 1, we conclude that X ' must lie on the segment between P' 
and Q', thus proving that the image of PQ is contained in the segment
F Q 7. ______

We must still prove that every point of the segment P'Q' can be expressed 
as the image under F  of a point on QP. Let X ' be a point on P'Q' at distance 
r from P'. Let X  be the point on PQ at distance r from P. Then F(X) is at 
distance r from F(P) = P'. It follows that F(X) = X '.

Remark. In this proof, we want to show that two sets of points are equal. 
We have followed a standard pattern, namely we have proved that each one 
is part of the other. This pattern will be repeated later.

Corollary. An isometry preserves straight lines. In other words, if L is a 
straight line in the plane and F is an isometry, then F(L) (the image of L 
under F) is also a straight line. If L is the line passing through two distinct 
points P, Q, then F(L) is the line passing through F(P) and F(Q).

Proof. We leave the proof as an exercise.

Example. Let O be the point of intersection of the diagonals of a rectangle. 
If we reflect through O, then the opposite corners are mapped on each other,



146 ISOMETRIES [6, §2;

and hence the opposite sides are mapped on each other, as illustrated in Fig. 
6-17.

Let F be a mapping of the plane into itself. We recall that a fixed point 
P of F  is a point such that F(P) = P. Fixed points of isometries will n o w  

play a very important role in describing all isometries. You should d e f in i t e l y  

do Exercise 2 of the preceding section if you have not already done it. We 
shall investigate systematically isometries with no fixed point, one f ix e e  

point, two fixed points, and three fixed points, but in reverse order. In this 
last case, we shall see that the isometry must be the identity. Then we 
consider each case with one less fixed point, and analyze it by composing the 
given isometry with a reflection, a rotation, or a translation to get the ultimate 
result that any isometry must be a composite of these. (For the definition o: 
a composite isometry, read ahead in §3.)

Theorem 2 . Let F be an isometry. Let P , Q be two distinct points in try
plane. Assume that they are fixed points, in other words

F(P) = P and F(Q) = Q.

Then every point on the line through P 9 Q is a fixed point of F.

Proof. We shall distinguish cases. Let M  be a point on the line passinx 
through P and Q. We wish to show that F(M) = M.

Case 1 . The point M  lies on the seg­
ment PQ. Let M' = F(M). Since F  pre­
serves distances, we have

d(P, M) = d(P, Af'), 
d(M',Q) = d(M,Q).

Hence

d(P,M') +  d(M',Q) = d(P,Q). Fig. 6-18



[6, §2] ISOMETRIES 147

By SEG 1, this means that M f lies on the segment between P and Q. Since

d(P9 M) = d(P9 M ' ) 9

it follows that M  = M'.

Case 2 . Suppose that M  does not lie on the segment PQ. Suppose that 
M  lies on the ray having vertex P and passing through Q, but at a distance 
from P greater than that of Q, as in Fig. 6-19.

Then

d(P9 M') = d(P9 M) = d(P9 Q) +  d(Q9 M)
= d{P9Q) +  d(Q9 M').

By SEG 1, this means that Q lies on the segment between P and M\ Hence 
P9 Q9 M r lie on the same straight line, and therefore M f lies on the straight 
line passing through P 9 Q. Since Q lies on the segment between P and Af', 
we conclude that M r lies on the ray having vertex P passing through Q. Since

d(P9 M) = d(P9 M f) 9

it follows that M  = M f.

Case 3. This case is similar to Case 2, when M  lies on the other side of 
P from Q. In this case, the role of P and Q is reversed, and the proof goes 
on as in Case 2, interchanging P and Q. This concludes the proof of Theorem 2.

Theorem 3. Let F be an isometry. Let P9 Q, M be three distinct points 
which do not lie on a straight line. Assume that P9 Q, M are fixed points 
of F; that is9

F(P) = P, F(Q) = Q9 F(M) = M.

Then F is the identity.



148 ISOMETRIES [6, §2;

Proof. Let Lpq and LQM be the lines passing through P , Q and Q, M , re­
spectively. Let X  be a point. We must show that F(X) = X. We can find a 
line L passing through X  which intersects LPQ in a point Z, and intersects Lqm 
in a point Y  such that Y 9* Z. (For instance, pick a point Z on Lqm which 
is distinct from Af, Q, X, and such that the line Lxz  is not parallel to Lpq. 
Let L = Lxz» and let Y  be the point of intersection of Lxz  and L pq.) The 
situation is illustrated in Fig. 6-20.

By Theorem 2, every point on the lines Lpq and Lqm are fixed. Therefore 
we have

F(Y)  = y  and F{Z) = Z.

Again by Theorem 2, every point on the line Lyz is fixed, and we conclude 
that F(X) = X. This proves our theorem.

Remark. A very important corollary of this theorem will be stated when 
we have the notion of inverse of an isometry, in §4.

preserving. Are Theorems 1 and 2 valid in 3-space? How would you 
formulate Theorem 3? (Consider the plane in which the three points 
lie.) Now formulate a theorem in 3-space about an isometry being the 
identity provided that it leaves enough points fixed. Describe a proof 
for such a theorem, similar to the proof of Theorem 3. Make a list of

this up as if you were writing a book. Aside from learning mathematical 
substance, you will also learn how to think more clearly, and how to 
write mathematics in the process.

150 ISOMETRIES [6, §3]

§3. COMPOSITION OF ISOMETRIES
We can take isometries in succession. For instance, we could first rotate 

the plane through an angle of 30° relative to a given point O; then reflect 
through a given line L\ then rotate again through an angle of 45°; finally 
make a translation. When we take such isometries in succession like that, 
we say that we compose them.

In general, let F, G be isometries. To each point P let us associate the 
point F(G(P))t obtained by first taking the image of P under G, and then 
the image of this latter point under F. Then we obtain an association

P ~ F (G (P )),

which is a mapping. In fact, this mapping is an isometry, because the distance 
between two points P , Q is the same as the distance between G(P), G(Q 
(because G is an isometry), and is the same as the distance between F(G(P 
F(G(Q)) (because F  is an isometry). The association

P h F(G(P))

is called the composite of G and F, and is denoted by the symbols

F oG.

Thus we have

( F oG K P )  = F(G(P)).



[6, §3] COMPOSITION OF ISOMETRIES 151

Example. Let O be a given point. Let F be rotation by 90° with respect 
to O, and let G be reflection through O. Then G ©F is rotation by 270°. We 
also see that F © F is rotation by 180°, and thus we may write

F o F = G.

Example. Let F be any isometry and let I be the identity. Then
F o l  = IoF

= F.

Thus I  behaves like multiplication by 1.

Composition o f rotations. If Fy G are rotations, relative to the same 
point Oy then F ©G is also a rotation, relative to O.

LetO be a given point and let r be a number > 0. Let P9 Q be points different 
from Oy at the same distance r from O. Then there exists a unique rotation 
Gpq relative to O, which maps P on Q (i.e. such that the value of Gpq at P is Q).

We shall assume these statements without proof. They are both in­
tuitively clear. Using them, we can write down a nice formula for the 
composite. Let P, Q, M  be points at distance r from O. Then

Gqm° Gpq = Gpm and Gpp = I.

Proof. The image of P  under the composite G q m ° G pq is 

G q m (Gpq(P ))  = Gq m (Q)

=  My

which is the same as the image of P under Gp m - By assumption there is only 
one rotation having this effect on P. Hence we get the first formula. The 
second is proved similarly, and even more simply.

In terms of numbers, we shall also assume without proof the following 
fact, which is intuitively clear.

Let Xy y be numbers. Let Gx be the rotation associated with x as in §1. Then

GX°Gy = GX-\-y.
For example,

G45 0 G45 = G9 0 .



152 ISOMETRIES [6, §3]

This means that a rotation by 45° followed by a rotation by 45° is the same 
as a rotation by 90°. Also, as in Fig. 6-22, we have

G l 8 0 ° G 2 7 0  =  ^ 450 =  ^ 90*

Fig. 6-22

Composition o f translations. If F , G are translations, then the com- 
posite FoG is also a translation.

Given points P , Q, there exists a unique translation Tpq such that the image 
of P under Tpq is Q.

Again, we assume these two statements without proof. As an exercise, 
prove the following formulas.

T qm °  T pq =  T pm  and Tpp = I.

Associativity o f isometries. Let Fy G, H be isometries. Then we have

(FoG)oH = Fo(GoH).

Proof. For any point P, we have

( (FoG) oH)(P) = (FoG )(ff(P)) = F(G(H(P))) 
(Fo (G o H))(P)  = F((GoH )(P)) = F(G(H(P))).

This proves our remark, because the two maps (F<>G)° H  and Fo (GoH 
have the same value at P, and this is true for every point P.



[6, §3] COMPOSITION OF ISOMETRIES 153

We shall use the same notation with isometries that we used with 
numbers for multiplication. If F is an isometry,

we denote FoF  by F2, 
we denote FoFoF  by F3,

and so on. We denote by Fn the isometry obtained by iterating F  with 
itself n times.

Example. Let G be the reflection through a given point O. Then we see that

G2 = identity = I.

This is like the relation ( — l ) 2 = 1. Note that we have:

G3 = G 
G4 = /

again in analogy with powers of —1.

Example. Let F  be rotation by 90°. Then:

F 2 = rotation by 180°,
F 3 = rotation by 270°,
F 4 = rotation by 360° = identity,
F5 = rotation by 90° = F.

Note this interesting cyclical nature of F, that F5 = F.

If F is an isometry, we define

F° = I.

Then for any natural numbers m, n we have the old relation

p m + n  =  p r n o p ri'

Thus composition behaves like a multiplication.

Example. Let T be translation by 1 in. to the right, and let P be a point. 
Then P, T(P), T2(P), T3(P), . . . are points on a horizontal line, and Tn+1(P) 
is 1 in. to the right of Tn(P). Draw one picture, with 0 ^ n ^ 5.

isometries to make up other beautiful patterns.

§4. INVERSE OF ISOMETRIES
Let F be an isometry. By an inverse (isometry) for F  we shall mean 

an isometry G such that

FoG = GoF = I.

Suppose that G and H  are inverses for F. Then

HoFoG = H o i  = H.

By associativity, the left-hand side is equal to

H  o F<>G = I  °G = G.
Thus we find

G = H.

This is the same type of proof which we used before to prove the uniqueness 
of the inverse, and we see that it applies to our present setting with isometries. 
We denote the inverse of F by F-1 if it exists. Assume that the inverse exists. 
If P, Q are points, then the relations

P = F(Q) and Q = F_1(P)

are equivalent. Indeed, if P = F(Q), then applying F-1 we obtain

F ~ \P ) = F - X(F(Q)) = Q,

and similarly for the converse. If P is the image of Q under F, then we also 
say that Q is the inverse image of P under F.



156 ISOMETRIES [6, §4]

Example. Let F  be reflection through a given line L. Since

F 2 = F °F  = I,
we conclude that

F~x = F.

Example. For each number x let Gx be the associated rotation through x 
degrees. Then

Gx 1 = G—x , 

because G_X°GX = Go = I- For instance,

G qo =  G 270  =  G_90 •

Also observe that if G = G 9 0 , then

G“ 1 = G3.

Example. Let T om denote the translation determined by the ordered pair 
of points (O, M ). This is the translation in the direction of the ray with 
vertex O, passing through M, and such that the image of a point P lies at 
distance from P equal to the length of the segment OM. Then T om has an 
inverse, which is none other than T m o , namely the translation going in the 
opposite direction, but the same distance, because we have

Tmo 0 Tom  =  I -

Example. Let F, G be isometries, having inverses F “ 1 and G~l, respectively. 
Then the composite F©G has an inverse, namely

(F0G) " 1 = G~l oF-\

This is easily seen. All we have to do is to verify that the right-hand side 
composed with F o G on either side yields the identity. But we have

G“ 1oF“ 1oF oG = G "1o/ oG = G“ 1 oG = /,

and similarly on the other side. This proves our assertion.

Let n be a negative integer, say n = —k, where dispositive. We define F~ 
to be the composite of F“ 1 with itself k times, i.e.

F~k = (F_1)\



Also we define F° = /  (identity). Then we have the formula

[6, §4] INVERSE OF ISOMETRIES 157

p m + n  =  p r n Qp n

valid for any values of m, n as integers. This relation is analogous to that 
holding for powers of numbers. We omit the proof, which is in any case easy.

Example. If T is the translation by 1 in. to the right, then T~l is the trans­
lation by 1 in. to the left. If U is the translation by 1 in. upward, then U~l is 
the translation by 1 in. downward. Also, T ~ 5 is the translation by 5 in. to the 
left, and t /“ 6 is the translation by 6 in. downward.

Using inverses, we can now prove a very useful corollary of Theorem 3 
which tells us when two isometries are equal.

Corollary o f Theorem 3. Let P, Q, M  be three distinct points which do 
not lie on the same line. Let F, G be isometries such that

F(P) = G(P), F(Q) = G(Q), F(M) = G(M).

Assume that F~l exists. Then F  = G.
Proof. The proof is very easy and will be left as an exercise.

Example. Let i f  be a vertical line and let L be a horizontal line. Let H  be 
reflection with respect to L and let V  be reflection with respect to K . Then 
H o V  = V oH. To see this, we have only to verify that Ho V and Vo H  
have the same effect on three comers of a square centered at the point of 
intersection of the lines, and this is clear.

Multiplication tables

Let us simplify the notation and write FG instead of F o G, to make the 
analogy with multiplication more striking. If Hf V  are the reflections along 
the horizontal line and vertical line, respectively, as above, then we can make



160 ISOMETRIES [6, §4]

a “ multiplication table” for the products of the four elements I , H , V, HV , 
as follows.

This multiplication table is to be read like a multiplication table for numbers. 
Where a row intersects a column, we have the value of the product of an 
element on the far left in the row, multiplied by the element on the top of 
each column. For instance, the product of H  and H V  is

HHV = V,
because

H 2 = I.

Similarly, the product of HV  and H V  is

HVHV  = HHVV 
= H 2V 2 

= I.

A multiplication table for numbers would look like this.

[6, §5] CHARACTERIZATION OF ISOMETRIES 163

§5. CHARACTERIZATION OF ISOMETRIES
The main result of this section is that an isometry can be expressed as a 

composite of a translation, a rotation, and possibly a reflection. We first 
prove an intermediate result.

Theorem 4. Let P , Q be distinct points. Let F be an isometry which leaves 
P and Q fixed. Then either F is the identity, or F is a reflection through the 
line Lpq passing through P and Q.

Proof. Let M  be a point on the perpendicular bisector of the segment 
PQ, but not lying on this segment, as in Fig. 6-29.

Fig. 6-29

Then
d(P, M )  =  d(Q, M ).

If M  is fixed by F, i.e. if F ( M ) =  M , then we can apply Theorem 3 to con­
clude that F  is the identity. Suppose that F ( M )  5* M . Let M ' =  F ( M ) as 
shown in Fig. 6-33. Since F  preserves distances, we have

d ( P , M ' )  =  d(M' ,Q) .

Hence by the corollary of the Pythagoras theorem, the point M ' lies on the 
perpendicular bisector of the segment PQ.

Let O be the point of intersection of PQ and M M ' , i.e. the midpoint 
between P and Q. Again since F  preserves distances, and since O is fixed 
under F  (by Theorem 2, §2) we have

d(0,  M ) =  d(0,  M r).

Hence M ' is the reflection of M  through the straight line Lpq. Let R denote 
the reflection through this line, so that we have R = B“ 1. We also have

R(M) = M' and R(Mf) = M.



164 ISOMETRIES [6, §5]

Consider the composite isometry

RoF.

It leaves P and Q fixed. Furthermore,

R(F(M)) = R(M') = M.

Hence RoF  leaves M  fixed. By Theorem 3, we conclude that R o F  = I. 
Composing with ii“ 1 = R on the left, we find

RoRo F = Rol,

whence
F = R,

and our theorem is proved.

Theorem  5. Let F be an isometry which leaves one point O fixed. Then 
either F is a rotation, or F is a rotation composed with a reflection through 
a line.
Proof. Let P be any point ^  O. If F(P) = P, then we are in the case 

of Theorem 4 and we are done. Suppose that F(P) ^ P , and let F(P) = P'. 
Since F preserves distances, we have

d(0 , P) = d(0 , P').

There exists a rotation with respect to O which maps P on P'. Let us denote 
this rotation by G. We know that G“ 1 is a rotation, and

G~\P ') = P.
Therefore

G-\F(P)) = G_1(P') = P.



[6, §5] CHARACTERIZATION OF ISOMETRIES 165

This means that G“ 1 °F  leaves P fixed. But G“ 1 o f  also leaves O fixed. 
Hence we can apply Theorem 4, and we conclude that G-1 o f  is either the 
identity or a reflection R. In the first case, we have

G_1o f  = / ,

whence composing with G on the left we find

GoG_1oF = G o / = G,

and hence
F = G

is a rotation.
In the second case, we find

G” 1 oF = ft,

whence
G °G  1 o F = G ° R

and
F  =  G o  R.

This proves our theorem.

Theorem  6. Lei F a/i arbitrary isometry of the plane. If F does not 
leave any point fixed, then F is either a translation, or the composite of a 
translation and a rotation, or the composite of a translation, a rotation, and 
a reflection through a line.

Proof. Suppose that F does not leave any point fixed. Let O be any point 
and let P = F(O). Let T be the translation such that T(0) = P. Then 
T~1 is a translation, and

T~\P) = O.

Hence

T-1 (F(0)) = T_1(P) = O.

This means that T“ 1 ° F leaves O fixed. But T~1 o F is an isometry. We can 
therefore apply Theorem 5, and we see that

T~l oF  = G or T " 1oF = Gofi,



where G is a rotation and R is a reflection through a line. In the first case, 
we find

F = ToG

and in the second case we find

F = T o G°R.

This proves our theorem.

§6. CONGRUENCES
Let S, S' be sets of points in the plane. We shall say that S is congruent 

to S' if there exists an isometry F such that the image F(S) is equal to S'.

Theorem  7. Two circles of the same radius are congruent.
Proof. Let the first circle be C(r, O), or radius r, centered at O, and let 

the other circle be C(r, O'), centered at O'. Let T be the translation which 
maps O on O'. We know that T preserves distances. Hence if P is at distance 
r from O, then T(P) is at distance r from T(O) = O'. Hence the image of the 
circle C(r, O) is contained in the circle C(r, O'). We must still show that every 
point on C(r, O') is the image of a point on C(r, O) under T. Let Q be a point 
at distance r from O'. Note that the point

P = T~HQ)



[6, §6] CONGRUENCES 167

is at distance r from O, and that T(P) = T(T_1(Q)) = Q. This proves our

To prove that two figures are congruent, it is often useful to use Exercise 
2 at the end of this section. We can then change one figure by any number of 
isometries. It suffices to prove that its image under these isometries is 
congruent to the other figure. We shall illustrate this by an example from 
classical geometry, after we prove the next theorem.

Theorem 8. Any two segments of the same length are congruent.

Proof. Let PQ and MN  be segments of the same length. Let T be the 
translation which maps M  on P. Then T(N) is at the same distance from 
T(M) = P as Q, because T is an isometry. Hence there exists a rotation G 
with respect to P such that G(T(N)) = Q. By Theorem 1 of §2, we conclude 
that G° T maps MN  on PQ, thus proving our theorem.

The two steps of the proof in Theorem 8 corresponding to T and G 
are illustrated in Fig. 6-31.

Look at Exercise 2. In the light of this exercise, we could also have 
phrased the proof of Theorem 8 as follows. We let T be the translation such 
that T(M) = P. Since the image of MN  under T is congruent to MN , we 
are reduced to the case when P = M, which we now assume. By assumption,

d(P, Q) = d(P,N).

Hence there exists a rotation G with respect to P such that G(N) = Q. 
By Theorem 1 of §2, we conclude that PN  is congruent to PQ. This concludes 
the proof.

Using language as we did, reducing the proof to the case when P = M, 
has the slight advantage whereby we avoid having to write the composite

assertion.

GoT  explicitly. We shall phrase the proof of Theorem 10 that way also. 
Note that Theorem 10 is a classical congruence case of elementary courses in 
plane geometry, finding its natural place within our present system.

Theorem 9. Let A PQM and AP'Q'M' be right triangles whose right 
angles are at Q and Q', respectively. Assume that the corresponding legs have 
the same lengths, that is:

d(P,Q) = d(P',Q ')
and

d(Q, M) = d(Q', M').

Then the triangles are congruent.

Proof. We leave the proof as an exercise. Observe that this theorem 
puts our old assumption RT in the context of congruences, as we anticipated 
in Chapter 5, §3.

Actually, Theorem 9 is a special case of a more general result, stated in 
the next theorem, and whose proof we shall give in full.

Theorem 10. Let A PQM and AP'Q'M' be triangles whose correspond- 
ing sides have equal lengths, that is

d(P,Q) = d(P'y Q')y 
d(P, M) = d(P', M')y 

d(Q, M) = d(Q't M').

These triangles are congruent.

Proof. There exists a translation which maps P on P'. Hence it suffices 
to prove our assertion when P = P' (cf. Exercise 2). We now assume this,
i.e. P = P'. Since d(P, Q) = d(P, Q'), there exists a rotation relative to P 
which maps Q on Q'. This rotation leaves P fixed. Again by Exercise 2, we 
are reduced to the case when

P = P'
and

Q = Q ' .

We assume that this is the case. Now either M  = M', or M 5* M'. Suppose 
M t* M'. We illustrate this by Fig. 6-32.



[6, §6] CONGRUENCES 169

Fig. 6-32

Let Lpq be the line passing through P and Q. By the Corollary of the Pythag­
oras theorem, and the fact that

we conclude that L pq is the perpendicular bisector of MM'. In particular, 
M f is the reflection of M  through L p q . Hence if we reflect M' through L p Qi 

we get M. Thus we have found a composite of isometries which map P on P', 
Q on Q', and M  on M By Theorem 1 of §2 we conclude that our triangles 
are congruent, as was to be shown.

Remark. In Theorems 7 through 10 we have dealt with figures which consist 
of line segments. Of course, we may also want to deal with other types of 
figures, for instance discs (cf. Exercise 1), or, say, the triangular region 
bounded by a triangle, or the region bounded by a rectangle. Because of this, 
it is useful to have a description of these regions in terms of line segments. 
We treat the triangle as an example.

Let A PQM be a triangle, and let S be the region bounded by the triangle. 
We represent S as the shaded region in Fig. 6-33(a).

d(P, M) = d(P, AT)
and

d(Q, M) = d(Q, AT),

We can give a definition of S using only the concept of a line segment by saying 
that S consists of all the points on all line segments P X , where X  ranges over 
all points of QM. Looking at Fig. 6-33 (b) convinces you that this indeed 
coincides with your geometric intuition of the triangular region. Using this 
definition, it is then very easy to see that if F is an isometry, the image F(S) 
is the triangular region bounded by the triangle whose vertices are F(P), 
F(Q), F(M). Carry out the proof in detail as an exercise. This definition is 
also the one that is used both in pure mathematics and applied mathematics 
(e.g. economics).

Similarly, let R pq and R PM be two rays which define an angle whose 
measure is less than 180°. The angle can be described as the set of all points 
on all segments XY , where X  is a point on R Pq and Y is a point on R p m > as

area. We may be interested as to how the area of a region behaves under an 
isometry. It is natural to take the following statement as a basic axiom.

Let S be a region of the plane, whose area is equal to a. Let F be an isometry. 
Then the area of F (S) is also equal to a.

To convince ourselves that this is a reasonable statement, we can use the 
characterization of isometries. If we visualize rotations, reflections, or 
translations, then our intuition tells us that, in each case, the area of a region 
is preserved under each one of these mappings. Since any isometry is a 
composite of such mappings, we see that the area of a region is preserved 
under an arbitrary isometry.

Let A be an angle and let F be an isometry. Then F(A) is an angle, whose 
measure is the same as that of A . We see this from the definition of an angle, 
looking at the portion of the angle A lying in a disc centered at the vertex of 
A y and using the fact that isometries preserve area. We have drawn the case

when the isometry is the translation Tpp> in Fig. 6-35. Note, however, that 
a reflection reverses the order of the rays which are used to compute the 
measure of the angle in counterclockwise direction. Draw the picture.

7 Anea and Applications

§1. AREA OF A DISC OF RADIUS r
We assume that the notion of area and its basic properties, corresponding 

to our simple intuition of area, are known. In particular, the area of a square 
of side a is a2, and the area of a rectangle whose sides have lengths a, b is ab. 
(Remember, a unit of length is fixed throughout, and determines a unit of 
area.)

Let r be a positive number, and consider dilation by r. We wish to analyze 
what happens to area under such a dilation. We start with the simplest case, 
that of a rectangle. Consider a rectangle whose sides have lengths a and b as 
on Fig. 7-1 (a). Suppose that we multiply the lengths of the sides by 2, and 
obtain the rectangle illustrated on Fig. 7-1 (b).

26-

(a)

2 a 

(b)
Fig. 7-1

Then the sides of this dilated rectangle have lengths 2a and 26. Hence the 
area of the dilated rectangle is equal to 2a2b = 4ab = 22a6. Similarly, 
suppose that we dilate the sides by 3, as illustrated on Fig. 7-1 (c).

36-

(c) Fig. 7-1 (cont.)

1 7 3



1 7 4 AREA AND APPLICATIONS [7 , §1]

Then the sides of the dilated rectangle have lengths 3a and 36, whence the 
area of the dilated rectangle is equal to 3a36 = 9a6 = 32a6.

In general, let S be a rectangle whose sides have lengths a, 6 respectively. 
Let rS be the dilation of S by r. Then the sides of rS have lengths ra and rb 
respectively, so that the area of the dilated rectangle rS is equal to

(ra)(r6) = r2ab.

Thus the area of rectangles changes by r2 under dilation by r.
This makes it very plausible that if S is an arbitrary region of the plane, 

whose area can be approximated by the area of a finite number of rectangles, 
then the area of S itself changes by r2 under dilation by r. In other words,

area of rS = r2 (area of S).

For instance, let Dr be the disc of radius r, so that D i = D is the disc of 
radius 1, both centered at the origin (see Fig. 7-2). Then Dr = rDi.

Fig. 7-2

Letx denote the numerical value of the area of D\. Then it is plausible that

area of Dr = irr2.

We used the symbol7r to denote the area of D\. It is of course a problem 
to determine its numerical value. Various devices allow us to do this, and 
we find the familiar decimal, 7r = 3.14159 . . . .  There is the possibility that 
you have heard of 7r only as the ratio of the circumference to the diameter 
of a circle of radius 1. In the next section, we shall indicate how to prove 
that this ratio has the same value as the area of the disc of radius 1. Thus the 
7r we are using now is the same one that you may know already. This 
relationship then gives us a method for computing 7r. For instance, get a 
circular pan and a soft measuring tape, measure the circumference of the pan, 
measure its diameter, and take the ratio. This will give you a value for 7r, 
good at least to one decimal place. There are more sophisticated ways of



[7 , §1] AREA OF A DISC OF RADIUS r 1 7 5

finding more decimal places for 7r, and you will learn some of these in a 
subsequent course in calculus.

One of the methods used to compute 7r is also the method which convinces 
us that the area of a disc of radius r is7rr2. Namely, we approximate the disc 
by rectangles, or even squares, as in Fig. 7-3.

We draw a grid consisting of vertical and horizontal lines at the same 
distance from each other, thus determining a decomposition of the plane into 
squares. If the grid is fine enough, that is, if the sides of the square are 
sufficiently small, then the area of the disc is approximately equal to the 
sum of the areas of the squares which are contained in the disc. The difference 
between the area of the disc and this sum will be, at most, the sum of the 
areas of the squares which intersect the circle. To determine the area of the 
disc approximately, you just count all the squares that lie inside the circle, 
measure their sides, add up their areas, and get the desired approximation. 
Using fine graph paper, you can do this yourself and arrive at your own 
approximation of the area of the disc.

Of course, you want to estimate how good your approximation is. The 
difference between the sum of the areas of all the little squares contained in 
the disc and the area of the disc itself is determined by all the small portions 
of squares which touch the boundary of the disc, i.e. which touch the circle. 
We have a very strong intuition that the sum of such little squares will be 
quite small if our grid is fine enough, and in fact, we give an estimate for this 
smallness in the following discussion.

Suppose that we make the grid so that the squares have sides of length 
c. Then the diagonal of such a square has length cV 2. If a square intersects



1 7 6 AREA AND APPLICATIONS [7 , § l j

the circle, then any point on the square is at distance at most cV 2 from the 
circle. Look at Fig. 7-4 (a).

(a)

Fig. 7-4

This is because the distance between any two points of the square is at most 
c\/2 . Let us draw a band of width c\J2 on each side of the circle, as shown 
in Fig. 7-4 (b). Then all the squares which intersect the circle must lie 
within that band. It is very plausible that the area of the band is at most 
equal to

2cV 2 times the length of the circle.

Thus if we take c to be very small, i.e. if we take the grid to be a very fine 
grid, then we see that the area of the disc is approximated by the area covered 
by the square lying entirely inside the disc.

The same type of argument also works for more general regions. For 
instance, we have drawn a region S inside a curve in Fig. 7-5(a), and we 
have drawn the dilation of S by 2 in Fig. 7-5 (b). Then the area of 2S is 
equal to 4 A, where A is the area of S.

§2. CIRCUMFERENCE OF A CIRCLE OF RADIUS r

Let C be the circle of radius 1, and let Cr be the circle of radius r. We wish 
to convince ourselves that

length of Ci = 2tt, 

length of Cr = 2irr.

We studied area in the preceding section by approximating a region S by 
means of squares. To study length, we have to approximate a curve by means 
of straight line segments.

On the following picture, we show how to approximate a curve by 6 
segments.



[7 , §2] CIRCUMFERENCE OF A CIRCLE OF RADIUS r 1 81

To approximate a circle by segments, we select a special kind of segment. 
We decompose the disc of radius r into n sectors whose angles have

360 .---- degrees.n

Here, n is an integer. The picture is that of Fig. 7-8, drawn with n = 7.

Triangle Tn

polygon Fig. 7-8

You should now do Exercise 1, taking special values for n, namely 
n = 4, n = 5, n = 6, n = 8 (more if you wish). In each case, determine the 
number of degrees

360 360 360 360 
T ’ “ 5“ ’ ~6~’ I T ’ etc”

and draw the corresponding sectors. In general we then join the end points 
of the sectors by line segments, thus obtaining a polygon inscribed in the 
circle. The region bounded by this polygon consists of n triangles congruent 
to the same triangle Tn, lying between the segments from the origin O to the 
vertices of the polygon. Thus in the case of 4 sides, we call the triangle T4. 
In the figure with 5 sides, we call the triangle T 5. In the figure with 6 sides, 
we call the triangle T6. In the figure with 8 sides, we call the triangle T8. 
And so on, to the polygon having n sides, when we call the triangle Tn.

We denote the (length of the) base of T 4 by 64 and its height by h4. 
We denote the base of T 5 by 65 and its height by h5. In general, we denote 
the base of Tn by bn and its height by hn, as indicated on Fig. 7-8. Since the 
area of a triangle whose base has length b and whose height has length h



182 AREA AND APPLICATIONS [7, §2]

is \bh, we see that the area of our triangle Tn is given by

area of Tn = \bnhn.

Let An be the area of the region surrounded by the polygon, and let Pn 
be the perimeter of the polygon. Since the polygonal region consists of n 
triangular regions congruent to the same triangle Tn, we find that the area 
of A n is equal to n times the area of Tn, or in symbols,

An = n • area of Tn = \nbnhn.

On the other hand, the perimeter of the polygon consists of n segments whose 
lengths are all equal to 6n. Hence P n = nbn. Substituting P n for nbn in the 
value for A n which we just found, we get

A — i p  h**■71 —  2 nn ri'

As n becomes arbitrarily large,

An approaches the area of the disc Dr,
Pn approaches the circumference of the circle Cr,

and
hn approaches the radius r of the disc.

For instance, if we double the number of sides of the polygon successively, 
the picture looks like Fig. 7-9.

Fig. 7-9

Let c denote the circumference of the circle of radius r. Then A r. 
approaches 7rr2. Since A n = \Pnhn, it follows that A n also approaches \cr. 
Thus we obtain

7 it2 =  \cr.



[7, §2] CIRCUMFERENCE OF A CIRCLE OF RADIUS r 183

We cancel r from each side of this equation, and multiply both sides by 2. 
We conclude that

C = 2717*,

as was to be shown.
We have discussed above the behavior of area under dilation. We con­

clude this section by a discussion of the behavior of length under dilation.
Let r be a positive number. Under dilation by r, the distance between 

two points is multiplied by r; in other words,

d(rP,rQ) = r • d(P, Q).

When we have coordinates later, this will be proved. We can already justify 
it to some extent by using the Pythagoras theorem. Consider a right triangle 
A  POQ with sides a, b as shown in Fig. 7-10, such that the right angle is at 
the origin O.

Fig. 7-10

Under dilation by r, the two sides are dilated by r, so that the three points

rP, O, rQ,

form a right triangle whose legs have lengths ra and rb, respectively. By the 
Pythagoras theorem, the hypotenuse of the dilated triangle has length

V r2a2 +  r2b2 = V r 2(a2 +  b2) .
If we let

c = V a 2 +  b2 ,



184 AREA AND APPLICATIONS [7, §2]

we see that the hypotenuse has length re. Thus the length of the hypotenuse 
also gets multiplied by r. As we shall see later when we have coordinates, 
this is also true even if the vertex of the right angle is not necessarily at the 
origin.

To investigate what happens to the length of an arbitrary curve S under 
dilation, we approximate the curve by segments as on Fig. 7-7. In general, 
suppose that we approximate the curve by n segments where n is a positive 
integer. Let these segments be Si, . . .  , Sn. Let Z(St) denote the length of St. 
If we dilate the curve by r, then rS is approximated by the segments 
rSi, . . . , rSn. Hence the length of rS is approximated by

Z(rSi) +  • • • +  Z(rSn) = r[Z(Si) +  - • - +  Z(S»)].

Thus we see that whenever we can approximate S by line segments, we 
have the formula

length of rS = r (length of S).

In particular, the length of the circle of radius 1 is 27r, and the length of the 
circle of radius r is 27rr. We proved this above, and we now see that it is 
compatible with the general behavior of length under dilation.

Our arguments are based on the idea of taking a limit as n becomes 
arbitrarily large, and on the notion of approximation. These are the basic 
ideas of the calculus, which is devoted to systematizing these notions and 
giving an analytic basis for their logical development. However, it is always 
useful to have the intuitive ideas first. Thus you may view this section as a 
good introduction to the calculus.

EXERCISES

1. Draw the picture of a polygon with sides of equal length, inscribed in a 
circle of radius 2 inches, in the cases when the polygon has:
a) 4 sides, b) 5 sides, c) 6 sides,
d) 8 sides, e) 9 sides.
Draw the radii from the center of the circle to the vertices of the polygon. 
Use a protractor for the angles of the sectors. Using a ruler, measure



[7, §2] CIRCUMFERENCE OF A CIRCLE OF RADIUS r 185

(approximately) the base of each triangle and measure its height. From 
your measurements, compute the area inside the polygon, and the 
circumference of the polygon. Compare these values with the area of the 
disc and its circumference, given as irr2 and 2 7rr respectively, and r = 2. 
Use the value 7T = 3.14.

2. Get a tin can with as big a circular bottom as possible. Take a tape, 
measure the circumference of the bottom, measure the diameter, take 
the ratio and get a value for 7T, probably good to one decimal place. 
Do the same thing to another circular object, say a frying pan, and 
verify that you get the same value for 7T.

3. Read the definitions of coordinates at the beginning of Chapter 8. Then 
read the sections of Chapter 16 on induction and summation, and do the 
exercises at the end of these sections. The material just mentioned is 
logically self-contained, so you should have no trouble. It provides a 
direct continuation of the topics which were discussed concerning area 
and volumes. You will see how to compute the volume of a sphere and 
a cone, or other similar figures, in 3-space.





Part Three
COORDINATE GEOMETRY





As stated before, we shall see how to use coordinates to give definitions 
for geometric terms using only properties of numbers.

The chapters in this part are logically independent of each other to a 
large extent. For instance, the chapter on trigonometry could be read 
immediately after the introduction of coordinates in Chapter 8, §1, and the 
discussion of the distance formula between points. Many readers may want 
to do that, instead of reading first about translations, addition of points, etc. 
On the other hand, the chapter on segments, rays, and lines is also inde­
pendent of the trigonometry and the analytic geometry. These three chapters 
can be read in any order. Take your pick as to what approach you like most.

Giving coordinates to points not only allows us to give analytic proofs. 
It allows us also to compute in a way that the “ intuitive” geometry did not. 
For instance, given a coordinatized definition of straight lines, we can compute 
the point of intersection of two lines explicitly.

1 8 9





8  Coordinates and Geometry

§1. COORDINATE SYSTEMS
Once a unit length is selected, we can represent numbers as points on a 

line. We shall now extend this procedure to the plane, and to pairs of numbers.
In Fig. 8-1, we visualize a horizontal line and a vertical line intersecting 

at a point O, called the origin.

These lines will be called coordinate axes, or simply axes.
We select a unit length and cut the horizontal line into segments of 

lengths 1, 2, 3, . . . to the left and to the right. We do the same to the vertical 
line, but up and down, as indicated on Fig. 8- 2.

191



1 9 2 COORDINATES AND GEOMETRY [8, §1]

On the vertical line, we visualize the points going below O as corresponding 
to the negative integers, just as we visualized points on the left of the horizontal 
line as corresponding to negative integers. We follow the same idea as that 
used in grading a thermometer, where the numbers below zero are regarded 
as negative.

We can now cut the plane into squares whose sides have length 1.

We can describe each point where two lines intersect by a pair of integers. 
Suppose that we are given a pair of integers, like (1, 2). We go 1 unit to the 
right of the origin and up 2 units vertically to get the point (1, 2) which has 
been indicated in Fig. 8-3. We have also indicated the point (3, 4). The 
diagram is just like a map.



[8, §1] COORDINATE SYSTEMS 193

Furthermore, we could also use negative numbers. For instance, to 
describe the point ( — 3, —2), we go 3 units to the left of the origin and 2 
units vertically downward.

There is actually no reason why we should limit ourselves to points 
which are described by integers. For instance we can also describe the point 
(J, —1) and the point ( — V2, 3) as on Fig. 8-4.

Fig. 8-4

In general, if we take any point P in the plane and draw the perpendicular 
lines to the horizontal axis and to the vertical axis, we obtain two numbers 
x, y  as on Fig. 8-5.

p
r -

Fig. 8-5

We then say that the numbers x9 y  are the coordinates of the point P, and 
we write

P = (x9y).



1 9 4 COORDINATES AND GEOMETRY [8, §1]

Conversely, every pair of numbers (x, y) determines a point of the plane. 
If x is positive, then this point lies to the right of the vertical axis. If x is 
negative, then this point lies to the left of the vertical axis. If y  is positive, 
then this point lies above the horizontal axis. If y  is negative, then this point 
lies below the horizontal axis.

The coordinates of the origin are

O = (0, 0).

We usually call the horizontal axis the x-axis, and the vertical axis the y -axis 
(exceptions will always be noted explicitly). Thus if

P = (5, —10),

then we say that 5 is the ^-coordinate and —10 is the y-coordinate. 
Of course, if we don’t want to fix the use of x and y , then we say that 5 is the 
first coordinate, and —10 is the second coordinate. What matters here is 
the ordering of the coordinates, so that we can distinguish between a first 
and a second.

We can, and sometimes do, use other letters besides x and y  for co­
ordinates, for instance t and s, or u and v.

Our two axes separate the plane into four quadrants, which are numbered 
as indicated in Fig. 8- 6.

II I

III IV

Fig. 8-6

A point (x, y) lies in the first quadrant if and only if both x and y  are > 0. 
A point (x, y) lies in the fourth quadrant if and only if x > 0, but y  < 0.

Finally, we note that we placed our coordinates horizontally and vertically 
for convenience. We could also place the coordinates in a slanted way, as 
shown on Fig. 8-7.



[8 , §1] COORDINATE SYSTEMS 1 9 5

In Fig. 8-7, we have indicated the quadrants corresponding to this coordinate 
system, and we have indicated the point (3, —2) having coordinates 3 and —2 
with respect to this coordinate system. Of course, when we change the 
coordinate system, we also change the coordinates of a point.

Remark. Throughout this book, when we select a coordinate system, the 
positive direction of the second axis will always be determined by rotating 
counterclockwise the positive direction of the first axis through a right angle.

We observe that the selection of a coordinate system amounts to the 
same procedure that is used in constructing a map. For instance, on the 
following (slightly distorted) map, the coordinates of Los Angeles are 
( —6, —2), those of Chicago are (3, 2), and those of New York are (7.2, 3). 
(View the distortion in the same spirit as you view modern art.)

Big exercise

To be carried through this chapter and the next two chapters: Define a 
point in 3-space to be a triple of numbers

(Xi, JC2, *3).

Try to formulate the same results in this 3-dimensional case that we have 
done in the book for the 2-dimensional case. In particular, define distance, 
define addition of points, dilation, translations, straight lines in 3-space, the 
whole lot. Write it all up as if you were writing a book. This will make you 
really learn the subject. Point out the similarities with the 2-dimensional 
case, and point out the differences if any. You will find practically no dif­
ference! To give you some guidelines, we shall often state explicitly what you 
should do.

So to get you started, we draw in Fig. 8-9 a system of perpendicular 
coordinate axes in 3-space in a manner quite similar to 2-space.



[8, §2] DISTANCE BETW EEN POINTS 1 9 7

Fig. 8-9

Thus a point in 3-space is represented by three numbers, and from the 
analytic point of view, we define such a point to be a triple of numbers (x, y , z). 
For instance, (1, —2, 7) is a point in 3-space. We denote 3-space by R3.

§2. DISTANCE BETWEEN POINTS
First let us consider the distance between two points on a line. For 

instance, the distance between the points 1 and 4 on the line is 4 — 1 = 3 .

-------1------+------1------ 1------+------  Fig. 8-10
0 1 2 3 4

Observe that if we take the difference between 1 and 4 in the other direction, 
namely 1 —4, then we find —3, which is negative. However, if we then take 
the square, we find the same number, namely

( —3)2 = 32 = 9.

Thus when we take the square, it does not matter in which order we took the 
difference.



1 9 8 COORDINATES AND GEOMETRY [8 , §2]

Example. Find the square of the distance between the points —2 and 3 on 
the line.

------------------ 1---------------- ♦ -----------------1------------------1------------------1------------------1-----------------+ -----------------1------------------ F i g  8 - 1 1- 3  - 2  - 1  0 1 2 3 4 *  1 1

The square of this distance is

(3 -  ( —2))2 = (3 +  2)2 = 25;

or computing the other way,

( - 2  -  3)2 = ( —5)2 = 25.

Note that again we take the difference between the coordinates of the points, 
and that we can deal with points having negative coordinates. If we want the 
distance rather than its square, then we take the square root, and we find

V  ( —5)2 = V P  = V25 = 5.

Because of our universal convention that the square root of a positive number 
is taken to be positive, we see that we can express the general formula for 
the distance between points on a line as follows.

Let xi, X2 be points on a line. Then the distance between x\ and X2 is equal to

v (*1 -  X2)2.

Next we discuss distance between points in the plane, given a coordinate 
system, which we draw horizontally and vertically for convenience. We recall 
the Pythagoras theorem from plane geometry.

In a right triangle, let a, b be the lengths of the legs {i.e. the sides forming 
the right angle), and let c be the length of the third side {i.e. the hypotenuse). 
Then

a2 +  b2 = c2.



[8 , §2] .DISTANCE BETW EEN POINTS 1 9 9

Example. Let (1, 2) and (3, 5) be two points in the plane. Using the 
Pythagoras theorem, we wish to find the distance between them. First we 
draw the picture of the right triangle obtained from these two points, as on 
Fig. 8-13.

Fig. 8-13

We see that the square of the length of one side is equal to

(3 -  l )2 = 4.

The square of the length of the other side is

(5 _  2)2 = (3)2 = 9.

By the Pythagoras theorem, we conclude that the square of the length 
between the points is 4 +  9 = 13. Hence the distance itself is V l3.

Now in general, let (xi,y{) and (*2, ^2) be two points in the plane. We 
can again make up a right triangle, as shown in Fig. 8-14.

Fig. 8-14



2 0 0 COORDINATES AND GEOMETRY [8 , §2]

The square of the bottom side is (x2 — *i)2, which is also equal to (x\ — x2)2. 
The square of the vertical side is (y2 — y i)2, which is also equal to (y\ — y2)2. 
If d denotes the distance between the two points, then

d2 = (x2 -  x{)2 +  (y2 -  yi)2,

and therefore we get the formula for the distance between the points, namely

d = V (x2 -  * i )2 +  (y 2 -  y i)2.

Example. Let the two points be (1, 2) and (1, 3). Then the distance between 
them is equal to

V (1 -  l )2 +  (3 -  2)2 = 1.

Example. Find the distance between the points ( — 1,5) and (4, —3). 
This distance is equal to

V (4 -  ( - 1 ) )2 +  ( - 3  -  5)2 = V89.

Example. Find the distance between the points (2,4) and (1, —1). The 
square of the distance is equal to

(1 -  2)2 +  ( - 1  -  4)2 = 26.

Hence the distance is equal to V 26.

Warning: Always be careful when you meet minus signs. Place the 
parentheses correctly and remember the rules of algebra.

As it should be, we can compute the distance between points in any 
order. In the last example, the square of the distance is equal to

(2 -  l )2 +  (4 -  ( - 1 ))2 = 26.
If we let d(P,Q) denote the distance between points P and Q, then our 

last remark can also be expressed by saying that

d(P,Q) = d(Q,P).

Note that this is the basic property DIST 2 of Chapter 5.
We have the general program of giving foundations for geometry 

assuming only properties of numbers. In line with this program, we must 
make clear what we take as definitions. The rules of the game are that only 
properties of numbers can be assumed as known.



[8 , §2] DISTANCE BETW EEN POINTS 2 0 1

We therefore define the plane to be the set of all pairs (x, y) of real 
numbers. We denote the plane by R2.

If X  = (xi, x2) and Y  = (,yi ,y 2) are two points of the plane, then we 
define the distance between them to be

d{X, Y) = V(x2 -  Xl)2 +  (y2 - y i )*.

Thus we see that we have defined geometric objects using only numbers.

EXERCISES
Find the distance between the following points P and Q. Draw these 

points on a sheet of graph paper.

1. P = (2, 1) and Q = (1, 5)
2. P = ( -3 ,  — 1) and Q = ( -4 ,  - 6)
3. P = ( - 2, 1) and Q = (3, 7)
4. P = ( -3 ,  -4 )  and Q = ( - 2, -3 )

5. P = (3, - 2) and Q = ( - 6, -7 )

6. P = ( -3 ,  2) and Q = (6, 7)

7. P = ( -3 ,  -4 )  and Q = ( -1 ,  -2 )
8. P = ( -1 ,5 )  and Q = ( -4 ,  -2 )

9. P = (2,7) and Q = ( - 2, -7 )
10. P = (3 ,1) and Q = (4, - 1)
11. Prove that if d(P, Q) = 0, then P — Q. Thus we have now proved two 

of the basic properties of distance.
12. Let A = (oi, a2) and B = (&i. b2)- Let r be a positive number. Write 

down the formula for d(A, B). Define the dilation rA to be

rA = (rai, ra2).



2 0 2 COORDINATES AND GEOMETRY [8 , §2]

For instance, if A = ( — 3,5) and r = 7, then rA = ( — 21,35). If 
B = (4, —3) and r = 8, then rB = (32, —24). Prove in general that

d(rA, rB) = r • d(A, B).

We shall investigate dilations more thoroughly in the next chapter.

Exercise on 3-space

Let

A = (au a-s) and B = (&i, b2, 63) 

be points in 3-space. Define the distance between them to be

d(A, B) =  V(b! -  ai)2 +  (b2 -  a 2) 2 +  (63 -  a 3) 2-

This generalizes the Pythagoras theorem. Draw a picture. Draw the segment 
between the origin O = (0, 0, 0) and a point X  = (x, .y, 2). Write down the 
simple formula for the distance between (0, 0, 0) and (x, y , 2). Draw right 
triangles, showing that geometrically, our formula for the distance between
O and X  in 3-space can be justified in terms of an iterated application of the 
ordinary Pythagoras theorem in a horizontal plane and a vertical plane. 
Look back at the exercises of Chapter 5, §3, and note their relation with the 
present considerations.
13. Give the value for the distance between the following.

a) P = (1, 2, 4) and Q = ( -1 ,3 ,  - 2)
b) P = (1, -2 ,1 )  and Q = ( -1 ,1 ,1 )
c) P = ( -2 ,  -1 ,  -3 )  and Q = (3, 2, 1)
d) P = ( -4 ,  1, 1) and Q = (1, - 2, -5 )

14. Let r be a positive number. Define rA in a manner similar to the definition 
of Exercise 12. Prove that

d(rA, rB) = r • d(A, jB).



[8 , §3] EQUATION OF A CIRCLE 2 0 3

§3. EQUATION OF A CIRCLE
Let P be a given point and r a number > 0. The circle o f radius r 

centered at P is by definition the set of all points whose distance from P is 
equal to r. We can now express this condition in terms of coordinates.

Example. Let P = (1, 4) and let r = 3. A point whose coordinates are 
(x, y) lies on the circle of radius 3 centered at (1, 4) if and only if the distance 
between (x, y) and (1,4) is 3. This condition can be written as

(1) V (* -  1)2 +  (y -  4)2 = 3.

This relationship is called the equation of the circle of center (1,4) and radius
3. Note that both sides are positive. Thus this equation holds if and only if

(2) (x -  l )2 +  (y -  4)2 = 9.

Indeed, if (1) is true, then (2) is true because we can square each side of (1) 
and obtain (2). On the other hand, if (2) is true and we take the square root 
of each side, we obtain (1), because the numbers on each side of (1) are 
positive. It is often convenient to leave the equation of the circle in the form 
(2), to avoid writing the messy square root sign. We also call (2) the equation 
of the circle of radius 3 centered at (1, 4).

Example. The equation

(x -  2)2 +  (y +  5)2 = 16

is the equation of a circle of radius 4 centered at (2, —5). Indeed, the square 
of the distance between a point (x, y) and (2, —5) is

(x -  2)2 +  (y -  ( —5))2 = (x -  2)2 +  (y +  5)2.

Thus a point (x, y) lies on the prescribed circle if and only if

{x -  2)2 +  (y +  5)2 = 42 = 16.

Note especially the y  +  5 in this equation.

Example. The equation

(x +  2)2 +  (x +  3)2 = 7 

is the equation of a circle of radius V7 centered at ( — 2, —3).



2 0 4 COORDINATES AND GEOMETRY [8 , §3]

Example. The equation

x2 +  y 2 = 1

is the equation of a circle of radius 1 centered at the origin. More generally, 
let r be a number > 0. The equation

x2 +  y 2 = r2

is the equation of a circle of radius r centered at the origin. We can draw this 
circle as in Fig. 8-15.

In general, let a, b be two numbers, and r a number > 0. Then the equation 
of the circle of radius r, centered at (a, 6), is the equation

(x -  a)2 +  (y -  b)2 = r2.

This means that the circle is the set of all points satisfying this equation.

f) (x -  4)2 +  (y -  5)2 + z 2 = 11

§4. RATIONAL POINTS ON A CIRCLE
The result proved in this section is not essential for what follows, and 

may be skipped. It is, however, quite beautiful.
Let us go back to Pythagoras. We ask whether we 

can describe all right triangles with sides having 
lengths a, b, c such that

a2 +  b2 = c2

and a, 6, c are integers. For instance, we have a right 
triangle with sides 3, 4, 5, because

32 +  42 = 25 = 52.

First, it is not clear what we mean by “ describe all such right triangles” . 
Is there even another one? The answer to that is yes; for instance, a right 
triangle with sides (8, 15, 17). By experimenting, we might find still another, 
and the first question that arises is: Are there infinitely many? The answer 
to that is again yes, but is not immediately clear, although after we get 
through with our discussion, we shall see at once that there are infinitely 
many.

We shall transform our problem to an equivalent one. Observe that our 
equation

(*) a2 +  b2 = c2

is true if and only if

Fig. 8-16

(O'



[8, §4] RATIONAL POINTS ON A CIRCLE 207

All we need to do is to divide by c2 on both sides. If a, 6, c are integers, then 
the quotients a/c and b/c are rational numbers. Thus every solution of 
equation (*) yields a solution of the equation

(**) x2 +  y 2 = 1

with rational numbers x and y.
Conversely, suppose that x, y  are rational numbers satisfying equation 

(**). Express x, y as fractions over a common denominator, say c. Thus write

a , bx = -  and y = ~ c c

with integers a, 6, c such that c ^  0. Then

If we multiply both sides of this equation by c2, then we obtain (*), namely,

a2 +  b2 = c2.

Thus to solve (*) in integers, it suffices to solve (**) in rational numbers, 
and this is what we shall do.

A point (x, y) satisfying the equation x2 +  y 2 = 1 may be viewed as a 
point on the circle of radius 1, centered at the origin. Thus to solve (**) in 
rational numbers, we may say that we want to find all rational points on the 
circle. (A rational point (x, y) is by definition a point such that its co­
ordinates x, y  are rational numbers.)

Our next step is to give examples of such points.
For any number t, let

'- fr i  “ d * -TTTf

Simple algebraic manipulations will show you that

x2 +  y 2 = 1.

If we give t special values which are rational numbers, or integers, then 
both x and y  will be rational numbers, and this gives us our desired examples.

Example. Let t = 2. Then



2 0 8 COORDINATES AND GEOMETRY [8 , §4]

This yields an example which we already had, namely

Multiplying by 52 on both sides yields the relation

32 +  42 = 52, 

and thus we recover the (3, 4, 5) right triangle.

Example. Let t = 4. Then computing the values of x and y will show you 
that we recover the right triangle with sides (8, 15, 17).

Example. Let t = 5. Then

1 -  25 -2 4  , 2 -5  10x = ---------  = ------  and v = ---------  = — .1 +  25 26 ^ 1 +  25 26

Simplifying the fractions, we find that x = — y§ and y  = y$. This corresponds 
to a right triangle with sides 12, 5, and 13. Observe that

52 +  122 = 132.

It is clear that we have found a way of getting lots of rational points on 
the circle, or equivalently, lots of right triangles with integral sides. It is 
not difficult to show that two different values of t yield different points 
(x, y). (Can you prove this as an exercise?)

You can ask: How did we guess the formulas expressing x and y  in terms 
of t in the first place? Answer: These formulas have been known for a long 
time. As far as I know, history does not tell us who discovered them first, 
but he was a good mathematician. What distinguishes someone with talent 
for mathematics from someone without talent is that the first person will be 
able to discover such beautiful formulas and the second person will not.

However, everybody is able to plug numbers in the formula once it is 
written down. That does not take much talent.

We still have not solved our problem of rational points on the circle 
completely, namely we can ask: Are the points described by our two formulas

1 - 12 , 21
* - r + p  “ d * - t + t*

with rational values for t, the only rational points on the circle? In other 
words, does plugging rational numbers for t in these formulas yield all points



[8 , §4] RATIONAL POINTS ON A CIRCLE 2 0 9

(x, y) with rational x, y  lying on the circle? The answer is yes, with only one 
exception. It is based on the following result.

Theorem 1. Let (x, y) be a point satisfying the equation 

x2 +  y 2 = 1

and such thatx ^ — 1. (See Fig. 8-17.) 
Let

t =

Then

x = l -  r  
l +  t2 and y = 21

1 +  t2 * Fig. 8-17

Proof. Multiplying both sides of the equation t = y/(x +  1) by x +  1, 
we find that

Squaring yields 

which gives

t(x +  1) = y.

t2{x +  l ) 2 = y2,

t2 (x +  l ) 2 =  1 — X 2 =  (1  +  x ) ( l  — x ) .  

We cancel (x +  1) from both sides, and find

t2(x +  1) = 1 — x. 

Expanding the left-hand side yields

t2x +  t2 = 1 — x,

and also
(t2 +  l)x = 1 -  t2.

Dividing by t2 +  1 gives us our expression for x. Using

y  =  t(x +  l )



2 1 0 COORDINATES AND GEOMETRY [8, §4]

and an easy algebraic manipulation which we leave to you, we find the 
expression for y , namely

21
y ~ i  +  i2 ■

This proves our theorem.

In Theorem 1, suppose that x, y  are rational numbers. Then

is also a rational number. From the expression for x and y  in terms of t we 
conclude:

Corollary. Let x, y be rational numbers such that

x2 +  y2 = 1.

If x j* —1, then there exists a rational number t such that

» - f r i *  and y ~ T T ¥ -

So we have completely described the rational points on the circle, or 
equivalently, the right triangles with integral sides.

We could now ask further questions, like:

Determine all pairs of rational numbers (x, y) such that

x3 +  ys = i.

This is harder, but it can be shown that the only solutions are

x = 0 or x = 1,

with the obvious corresponding value for y. In general, given a positive 
integer k, the problem is to find all solutions of Fermat’s equation:

xk +  yk = 1;

say, with positive x and y. It is known for many values of k that there is no 
solution other than x = 0 or x = 1, but a solution in general is unknown. 
This is the famous Fermat problem.



[8, §4] RATIONAL POINTS ON A CIRCLE 2 1 1

EXERCISES
1. Write down explicitly five examples of positive integers (a, 6, c) such that

a2 +  b2 = c2,

which have not already been listed in the text and which are not multiples 
of those listed in the text.

2. Prove that if s, t are real numbers such that 0 ^ s < t, then

1 -  s2 1 -  t2 
1 +  s2 > 1 +  t2 •

[Hint: Prove appropriate inequalities for the numerators and denom­
inators, before taking the quotient.] This proves that different values 
for t > 0 already give different values for x .

3. Using the formulas of this section, give explicitly the values of x and y 
as quotients of integers, when t has the following values:

a) t = b) t = c) f = i, d) t =
4. When t becomes very large positive, what happens to

1 +  t2 *
When t becomes very large negative, what happens to

1 +  t2 '
Substitute large values of £, like 10,000 or —10,000, to get a feeling for 
what happens.

5. Analyze what happens to
21

1 +  t2
when t ^ 0 and when t becomes very large negative. Next analyze what 
happens when t ^ 0 and t becomes very large positive.





9 Operations on Points

§1. DILATIONS AND REFLECTIONS
From now on, unless otherwise specified, we deal with a fixed coordinate 

system. Thus we make no distinction between a point and its associated 
coordinates.

We use R to denote the set of all real numbers, and R 2 to denote the 
set of all pairs (x, y ), where x, y  are real numbers. Thus a point of the plane 
is simply an element of R 2.

Let A be a point in the plane, with coordinates

A = (ai, 02).

If c is any real number, we define the product cA to be the point

cA = (cai, ca2).

Thus we multiply each coordinate of A by c to get the coordinates of cA .

Example. Let A = (2, 5) and c = 6. Then cA = (12, 30).

Example. Let A = ( — 3, 7) and c = —4. Then cA = (12, —28).

We shall now interpret this multiplication geometrically.

Example. Suppose that c is positive, and let us draw the picture, with the 
point A = (1, 2) and c = 3. Then 3A = (3, 6), as on Fig. 9-1 (a).

213



2 1 4 OPERATIONS ON POINTS [9 , §1]

Fig. 9-1

Geometrically, we see that multiplication by 3 stretches the coordinates by
3. Similarly, if r is a positive number, then

rA = (r, 2r),

and we see that multiplication by r stretches the coordinates by r. For 
instance, stretching by \ amounts to halving, e.g. in Fig. 9-1 (b),

iA  = (J, 1).

Example. Let A = ( —2, 3) and r = 2. Then rA = ( —4, 6). Picture:



[9 , §1] DILATIONS AND REFLECTIONS 2 1 5

If r is a positive number, we call rA the dilation of A by r. The 
association

A i—> rA

which to each point A associates rA is called dilation by r, and gives us an 
analytic definition for the concept introduced in Chapter 6. It is dilation 
with respect to 0, and leaves 0  fixed.

Next, we consider the case when c is negative. If A = (ai, 02), we 
define — A to be ( —1)A, so that

- A  = ( —ai, —a2).

Example. Let A = (1,2). Then — A = ( — 1, —2). We represent —A in 
Fig. 9-3.

Fig. 9-3

Example. Let A = ( —2,3). Then — A = (2, —3). We draw A and — A 
in Fig. 9-4.

Fig. 9-4



2 1 6 OPERATIONS ON POINTS [9 , §1]

We see that — A is obtained by a certain symmetry, which justifies the 
next definition.

We define reflection through our given origin O to be the association 
which to each point A associates the point — A. As usual, this association 
is denoted by

A i—► — A.

If R denotes reflection through O, then

R(A) = - A .

Thus we have been able to give a definition of reflection using only numbers 
and their properties, i.e. an analytic definition.

If c is negative, we write c = — r, where r is positive, and we see that 
multiplication of A by c can be obtained by first multiplying A by r and then 
taking the reflection — rA. Thus we can say that — rA points in the opposite 
direction from A, with a stretch of r. We have drawn an example with 
A = (1, 2) and c = —3 in Fig. 9-5.

We now consider the effect of a dilation on distances.
Theorem 1. Let r be a positive number. If  A, B are points, then

d{rA,rB) = r - d(A, B).



[9 , §1] DILATIONS AND REFLECTIONS 2 1 7

Proof. This was assigned as an exercise in the preceding chapter. We 
work it out here, so that you see how simple it is. Let A = (aj, a2) and 
B = (bi, 62) as usual. Then rA = (rai, ra2) and rB = {rb 1 , rb2). Hence

d(rA, rB)2 = (rb\ — ra\)2 +  (rb2 — ra2)2 
= (r(6i -  ai))2 +  (r(b2 -  a2))2 
= r2(b\ -  ai)2 +  r2(b2 -  a2)2 
= r2 -d(A, B)2.

Taking the square root proves our theorem.

What happens to the distance under multiplication of points by a 
negative number c? Recall that the absolute value of a number c is defined 
to be

\c\ = V c2.

Thus | —3| = = V9 = 3.

Theorem 2. Let c be a number. Then

d(cAf cB) = \c\ • d(A, B).

Proof. The proof follows exactly the same pattern as the proof of 
Theorem 1, except that, at the very end when we take V c2 instead of r2, we 
find \c\ instead of r. Write this proof out in full.

EXERCISES
1. Write the coordinates for cA for the following values of c and A. In 

each case, draw A and cA.
a) A = ( —3, 5) and c = 4 b) A = (4, —2) and c = 3
c) A = ( —4, —5) and c = 2 d) A = (2, —3) and c = —2
e) A = ( —4, —5) and c = —1 f) A = (2, —3) and c = 2

that b = c.



2 1 8 OPERATIONS ON POINTS [9 , §2]

3. Prove that reflection through O preserves distances. In other words, 
prove that

d(A,B) = d{ — A, - B ).

4. The 3-dimensional case
a) Define the multiplication (dilation) of a point A = (a\, a2, 03) by a 

number c. Write out interpretations for this similar to those we did 
in the plane. Draw pictures.

b) Define reflection of A through O = (0, 0, 0).
c) State and prove the analogs of Theorems 1 and 2.

§2. ADDITION, SUBTRACTION, AND THE PARALLELOGRAM LAW
Let A and B be points in the plane. We write their coordinates,

A = (ai, 02) and B = (61, 62).

We define their sum A +  B to be

A +  B = (ai +  61, a2 +  62).

Thus we define their sum componentwise.

Example. Let A = (1, 4) and B = ( — 1, 5). Then

A +  B = (1 -  1, 4 +  5) = (0, 9).

Example. Let A = ( —3,6) and B = ( —2, —7). Then

A +  B = ( - 3  -  2, 6 -  7) = ( -5 ,  -1 ).

This addition satisfies properties similar to the addition of numbers — 
and no wonder, since the coordinates of a point are numbers. Thus we have 
for any points A, B, C:

Commutativity. A +  B = B +  A.

Associativity. A +  (B +  C) = (A +  B) +  C.



Zero element. LetO = (0, 0). Then A +  O = O +  A = A.

Additive inverse. If A = (ai, a2) then the point

- A  = ( -a i ,  —a2)
is swc/i t/iai

A +  ( - A )  = O.

These properties are immediately proved from the definitions. For 
instance, let us prove the first one. We have:

A +  B = (a\ +  61, a2 +  b2) = (61 +  a\y b2 +  a2) = B +  A.

Our proof simply reduces the property concerning points to the analogous 
property concerning numbers. The same principle applies to the other 
properties. Note especially the additive inverse. For instance,

if A = (2, —5), then — A = ( —2, 5).

As with numbers, we shall write A — B instead of A +  ( — B).

Example. If A = (2, —5) and B = (3, —4), then

A — B = (2 -  3, —5 — ( -4 ) )  = ( -1 ,  -1 ) .

We shall now interpret this addition and subtraction geometrically. 
We consider examples.

Example. Let A = (1, 2) and B = (3, 1). To find A +  B, we start at 
A, go 3 units to the right, and 1 unit up, as shown in Fig. 9-6(a) and (b).

[9, §2] ADDITION, SUBTRACTION, AND PARALLELOGRAM LAW  2 1 9

Fig. 9-6



2 2 0 OPERATIONS ON POINTS [9 , §2]

Thus we see geometrically that A +  B is obtained from A  by the same 
procedure as B is obtained from O. In this geometric representation, we also 
see that the line segment between A  and A  +  B is parallel to the line segment 
between O and B, as shown in Fig. 9-6(a). Similarly, the line segment 
between O and A  is parallel to the line segment between B and A  +  B. 
Thus the four points

O, Ay By A  +  B

form the four corners of a parallelogram, which we draw in Fig. 9-6 (c).

Fig. 9-6 (cont.)

This gives us a geometric interpretation of addition.

Next, we consider subtraction.

Example. Let A  = (1,2) and B = (3, 1). Then A  — B = ( —2, 1). 
By definition, A — B = A  +  ( — B). Thus we can represent this subtraction 
as in Fig. 9-7.

Fig. 9-7

The four points O, A, B y A  — B are still the four corners of a parallelo­
gram, but starting from A we have to move in the opposite direction to go 
from A to A — B than when we moved from A to A +  B.



[9 , §2] ADDITION, SUBTRACTION, AND PARALLELOGRAM LAW  2 2 1

Observe that the point A can be written in the form

A = (A — B) +  B.

Thus we also obtain a parallelogram whose corners are O, A — B, A, B.
Let A be a fixed element of R2. We define the translation by A to be 

the association which to each point P of the plane associates the point 
P +  A. In Fig. 9-8, we have drawn the effect of this translation on several 
points.

The association
P P +  A

has been represented by arrows in Fig. 9-8.
It is useful to abbreviate “ translation by A ” by the symbol TA. You 

should read Chapter 6, §1, which now applies to the present situation. By 
definition, the value of Ta at a point P is

TA(P) = P +  A.

Example. Let A = ( —2, 3) and P = (1, 5). Then

Ta(P) = P +  A = ( -1 ,8 ) .
We see that we have been able to define one more of the intuitive geo­

metric notions within our system of coordinates, based only on properties of 
numbers.

So far, we have given analytic definitions (i.e. definitions based only on 
properties of numbers) for points, distance, reflection through O, and trans­
lation. We recall that a mapping of the plane into itself is an association 
which to each point P associates another point. If the mapping is denoted 
by F, then this other point is denoted by F(P), and is called the value of F 
at P. If F is translation by A, i.e. if F = TA, then P +  A is the value of 
F at P.



222 OPERATIONS ON POINTS [9 , §2]

Our previous definition of isometry now makes sense analytically: An 
isometry is a mapping of the plane into itself which preserves distances. 
In other words, F is an isometry if and only if, for every pair of points P, Q, 
we have

d(P, Q) = d(F(P)t F(Q)).

Since we have introduced addition and subtraction for points, we shall now 
describe a way of expressing the distance between points by using subtraction.

We recall that the distance between two points P, Q is denoted by d(P, Q). 
We shall use a special symbol for the distance between a point and the origin, 
namely the absolute value sign. We let

d(A,0) = |A|.

Thus we use two vertical bars on the sides of A. If A = (ai, 02), then

|A| = 's/a\ +  a2,
and therefore

\A\2 = a i  +  a l

We call |A| the norm of A. The norm generalizes the absolute value of a 
number. We can represent the norm of A as in Fig. 9-9. Geometrically, it is 
the length of the line segment from O to A.

a2

0

Note that |A| = |— A\. Proof?

Using our addition of points, or rather subtraction, we can express the 
distance between two points A, B by

d(A, B) = IA -  B\ = \B -  A |.



[9 , §2] ADDITION, SUBTRACTION, AND PARALLELOGRAM LAW 2 2 3

Indeed, if A = (ai, 02) and B = (61, 62), then

d(A, B) = V(bt -  a j)2 +  (b2 -  a2)2 = |B -  A|
= V(aj -  6i)2 +  (a2 -  b2)2 = |A -  B\.

With this notation, we see that a mapping F of the plane into itself is an 
isometry if and only if for every pair of points P, Q we have

IF(P) -  F(Q)I = IP -  Q|.

With this notation, a special case of Theorem 2 of §1 can now be written:

\cA\ = \c\ \A\.

If r is a positive number, then

M| = r\A\.

We suggest that you read the section on mappings in Chapter 6 if you 
have not already done so. We recall some definitions. If F is a mapping of 
the plane into itself, and P is a point, then F(P) is also called the image 
of P under F. If S is a subset of the plane, then we denote by F(S) the set of 
all points F(P) with P in S, and call F(S) the image of S under F .

We can now prove analytically a result which was intuitively clear.

Theorem 3. The circle of radius r and center A is the translation by A 
of the circle of radius r and center O.

Proof. Let X  be a point on the circle of radius r and center O. This 
means that

|X| = r.

The translation of X  by A, which is X  +  A, satisfies the condition

\X +  A -  A\ = r.

Thus we see that X  +  A is at distance r from A, and hence lies on the circle 
of radius r centered at A. Conversely, given a point Y  on this circle, so that

\Y -  A\ = r,
let X  = Y — A. Then Y = X  +  A is the translation of X  by A, and 
|X| = r. Therefore every point on the circle of radius r, centered at A, is the



2 2 4 OPERATIONS ON POINTS [9 , §2]

image under TA of a point on the circle of radius r centered at O. This proves 
our theorem.

Actually, you can also do Exercise 11, and then the proof given for 
Theorem 7 of Chapter 6, §6 is seen to be essentially the same proof as that 
given above.

Finally, we make a remark concerning the relation between addition 
and the multiplication of points by numbers as in §1. We ask whether the 
ordinary rules which we had for numbers also apply, and the answer is yes. 
Namely, we have:

Associativity. I f b, c are numbers, then b(cA) = (be) A.

Distributivity. If b, c are numbers, and A, B are points, then

(b +  c)A = bA +  cA and c(A +  B) = cA +  c£.

Also,
1A = A and OA = O.

The proofs are easy, since we can reduce each statement to the analogous 
property for numbers. For instance, to prove one of the distributivities, 
we have:

(b +  c)A = ((b +  c)ai, (b +  c)a2) by definition
= (ba\ +  cai, ba2 +  ca2) by distributivity for numbers 
= (bai, ba2) +  (cai, ca2) by definition 
= bA +  cA.

We leave the proofs of the other properties to you. They are just as easy, 
or easier.

10 Segments, Rays and Unes

§1. SEGMENTS 
Line segments

Let P, Q be points in the plane. We can write Q = P +  A for some A, 
namely A = Q — P. We wish to give an analytic definition of the line 
segment between P and Q, as shown in Fig. 10-1 (a).

Fig. 10-1

This is easy. We define this segment to be the set of all points

P +  tA, with 0 ^ t ^ 1.

Example. The point halfway between P and P +  A is the point

P +  iA.

Example. The line segment between O and A consists of all dilations tA 
with 0 ^ ^ 1, as in Fig. 10-1 (b). Thus we see that the line segment 
between P and P +  A is simply the translation by P of the line segment 
between O and A.

229



230 SEGMENTS, RAYS, AND LINES [10, §1]

The line segment between points P and Q is denoted by PQ. Let 
Q = P +  A. Then in the notation of mappings, we have

TP(OA) = PQ.

The line segment PQ is the image under Tp of the line segment OA. The 
length of a line segment PQ is simply the distance between P and Q.

The line segment between P and Q consists of all points

P +  t(Q -  P), 0 ^ t ^ 1.

The above expression can be written in the form P +  tQ — tP, or, in other 
words,

(1 -  t)P +  tQ.

Let s = 1 — t and t = 1 — s. When t takes on all values from 0 to 1, we 
see that s takes on all values from 1 to 0. The points of the line segment 
between P and Q can be written in the form

sP +  (1 — s)Q, 0 ^ s ^ 1.

Thus we see that the segment between P and Q consists of the same points 
as the segment between Q and P. Of course, we had a right to expect this. 
Thus we have

PQ = QP.

It does not matter which is written first, P or Q.
We can define another concept, that of 

directed segment, or located vector, in 
which the order does matter. Thus we define 
a located vector to be an ordered pair of 
points, which we denote by the symbols

PQ.

The arrow on top means that P is the first 
point and Q is the second. We draw a located 
vector as an arrow, shown in Fig. 10-2. Fig. 10-2

We say that P is the beginning point and Q is the end point of the 
located vector. We say that the located vector is located at P. Having 
ordered our points, we see that



[10, §2] RAYS 231

§2. RAYS

Let OA be a located vector, located at the origin, such that A ^ O. Let 
P be a point. We define the ray with vertex P, in the direction o f 
OA, to be the set of all points

(1) P +  tA,

Observe that the set of all points tA, with t ^ 0 is a ray with vertex at the 
origin, in the direction of OA, as on Fig. 10-3. Thus the ray with vertex P 
in the direction of OA is the translation by P of the ray consisting of all 
points tA with t ^0.

Fig. 10-3

Because the origin O has been fixed throughout our discussion, the 
mention of O when we speak of the ray in the direction of OA is superfluous, 
and we shall also say that this ray has the direction o f A. Such a ray, with 
vertex P, is completely determined by the expression in (1), which involves 
simply P and A (and all numbers t ^ 0).

Example. Let

and
P = ( -1 ,3 )

A = (2, 1).

Letting t = 5, we see that the point

( -1 ,3 )  +  5(2,1) = (9,8)

lies on the ray with vertex P in the direction of A. Similarly, letting t = 
we see that the point

( -1 ,3 )  +  §(2,1) = ( - & # )

lies on this ray.



232 SEGMENTS, RAYS, AND LINES [10, §2]

Given two points P, Q such that P Q, we can define the ray with 
vertex P, passing through Q to be the ray with vertex P in the direction 
of Q — P. This ray consists therefore of all points

P +  t(Q -  P), t ^ 0.

Example. Let P = ( — 1, 3) and Q = (2, 5). Then Q — P = (3, 2). The 
ray with vertex P passing through Q is shown in Fig. 10-4. It consists of all 
points

( -1 ,  3) +  t(2, 5) = ( - 1  +  2f, 3 +  51)

with t ^ 0.

Fig. 10—4

Remark. Let A be a point O. Let c be a positive number. Then the ray 
having a given vertex P in the direction of A is the same as the ray having this 
same vertex P in the direction of cA.

Proof. The first ray consists of all points

P +  tA, t ^ 0.

The second ray consists of all points

P +  scA, s ^ 0.

The point P is common to both of them, as we see by taking t = s = 0. 
Suppose that we have a point P +  tA on the first with a given value of t. 
Let s = t/c. Then this point can be written in the form P +  sc A, with s ^ 0, 
and hence is also a point of the second ray. Conversely given a point on the 
second ray, we let t = sc, and therefore see that it is also a point on the 
first ray. Thus the two rays are equal.



[10, §2] RAYS 233

Our remark, combined with our geometric intuition, leads us to make a 
definition. Let A O and B -A O. We say that OA and OB have the same 
direction (or also that A and B have the same direction) if there exists a 
number c > 0 such that

B = cA.

Since we can then write A = (1 /c)B, we see that A and B have the same 
direction if and only if each is a positive multiple of the other. We could 
also say that each is the dilation of the other by a positive number.

Similarly, let PQ and MN  be located vectors. We say that they have the 
same direction if there exists a number c > 0 such that

Q -  P = c(N -  M).

We draw located vectors having the same direction in Fig. 10-5.

Fig. 10-5

Example. The two points A = (3, 5) and B = (9, 15) define the same 
direction. According to our convention, this means that OA and OB have 
the same direction. We see that B is just the dilation of A by 3.

Example. The located vectors PQ and MN  have the same direction if 

P = (1, 3), Q = ( -4 ,  2), M  = (7, 1), N  = ( -3 ,  -1 )  

because
Q -  P = ( -5 ,  -1 )

and
N  -  M  = (-10 , -2 )

so that N  — M  = 2(Q — P).



2 3 4 SEGMENTS, RAYS, AND LINES [10, §2]

Example. Let

P = ( -3 ,5 ) ,  Q = (1,2), M  = (4,1).

Find the point N  such that MN  has the same direction as PQ, and such that 
the length of PQ is the same as the length of M N .

We need to find N  such that

N  -  M  = Q -  P,

and hence
N  = M  +  Q -  P.

We can solve this easily by adding and subtracting components, and we get
N  = (4,1) +  (1,2) -  ( -3 ,5 )

= (8, - 2).

This solves our problem.

Example. In physics, located vectors are very useful to represent physical 
forces. For instance, suppose that a particle is at a point P, and that a 
force is acting on the particle with a certain magnitude and direction. We 
represent this direction by a located vector, and the magnitude by the length 
of this located vector. Thus when we draw the picture

Q

Fig. 1 0 - 6

we can interpret it as a force acting on the particle at P.
Similarly, suppose that an airplane is located at O as in Fig. 10-7. We 

can interpret OA as the force of the wind acting on the plane. If the pilot 
runs his engines with a certain force, and gives direction to the airplane by 
placing his rudders a certain way, we can also represent this force and 
direction by a located vector OB.



[10, §2] RAYS 235

It can be verified experimentally that under these two forces, the airplane 
moves in a manner described by addition as we defined it; namely, in the 
direction of A +  B. Furthermore, the resultant of the two forces acting on 
the airplane has a magnitude equal to the norm of A +  B, i.e. \A +  B\. 
Thus our concepts of distance, located vectors, and vector sums are used 
constantly in the sciences.

§3. LINES

We first discuss the notion of parallelism, and give an analytic definition 
for it.

Let PQ and MN  be located vectors such that P Q and M  ^ N. We 
shall say that they are parallel if there exists a number c such that

Q -  P = c(M  -  N).



[1 0 , §3] LINES 2 3 7

Observe that this time we may take c to be positive or negative. Our definition 
applies equally well to segments PQ or MN  instead of located vectors, i.e. we 
can take P, Q in any order, and we can take M , N  in any order.

As an exercise, prove:

If PiQi is parallel to P 2Q 2 , and if P 2Q2 , is parallel to P 3Q 3 , then P 1Q 1

is parallel to P3Q3.
If PQ is parallel to MN, then MN  is parallel to PQ.

Similarly, let A 5* O and B O. We define A to be parallel to B if 
there exists a number c 9̂  0 such that A = cB. This amounts to saying that 
OA is parallel to OB. Having fixed our origin O, it suffices to give the end point 
of the segment OA to determine parallelism with respect to OA.

In Fig. 10-8 (a) we illustrate parallel located vectors. In Fig. 10-8(b), we 
see that the end points of located vectors OA and OB lie on the same line, 
when A, B are parallel.

Fig. 10-8

Figure 10-8(b) suggests to us how to give an analytic definition for a line. 
Let A be a point 9̂  O. We define the straight line (or simply the line) 
parallel to OA (or to A) passing through the origin to be the set of all points 
tA, with all real numbers t.

For an arbitrary line, not necessarily passing through the origin, we just 
take a translation.

We define the straight line (or simply the line) passing through a given 
point P, parallel to OA (or more simply, parallel to A) to be the set of all 
points

P +  tA,



with all real numbers t, positive, negative, or 0. Picture:

2 3 8  SEGMENTS, RAYS, AND LINES [1 0 , §3]

In Fig. 10-9, we have drawn the point P +  tA corresponding to a negative 
value of t.

We shall also use the symbols

{P +  tA} t in R

to denote this straight line.

Example. The line passing through the point ( —3,4), parallel to (1, —5) 
is the set of all points

( -3 ,4 )  +  f( 1, -1 ) ,  t in R.

It is easy to draw a picture of this line. We merely find two points on it and 
draw the line through these two points. For instance, giving t the value 0 
we see that ( — 3, 4) is on the line. Giving t the value 1 we see that the point

( -3 ,4 )  +  (1, -1 )  = ( -2 ,3 )

is on the line. This line is illustrated on Fig. 10-10.

Fig. 10-10



[1 0 , §3] LINES 2 3 9

The representation of a line in the form P +  tA is called a parametric 
representation, and we call t the parameter. One sometimes interprets 
the point P +  tA as describing the position of a bug, or a particle, moving 
along the line with uniform speed, and we interpret t as the time. Thus at 
time t = 0, the bug is at the point P. The coordinates (x, y) of a point on the 
line then depend on t, and it is customary to write them in the form

to indicate this dependence on t. This parametric representation of a straight 
line is advantageous for at least two reasons. First, it generalizes easily to 
3-space. Second, it represents our physical intuition of the moving bug, and 
allows us to give a simple coordinate representation for the position of the 
bug at a given time.

Example. Let
P = ( -1 ,4 )  and A = (2,3).

Then the coordinates for an arbitrary point on the line passing through P 
parallel to A are given by

Example. Find a parametric representation of a line passing through two 
points P = (1, 5) and Q = ( —2, 3); see Fig. 10-11.

x(t) = —1 + 2 1
and

y(t) = 4 +  3f.

Let A = Q — P. Then the parametric representation is

P +  tA = P +  t(Q -  P).

In terms of the individual coordinates, Q — P = ( —3, —2), and hence

x(t) = 1 - 3 1, y(t) = 5 - 2 t.

Observe that when t = 0, we obtain the point P, and when t = 1, we obtain 
the point Q. Thus we have found a parametric representation of a line 
passing through P and Q. We can also write this representation in the form

{(1,5) -  t(3, 2)} linR.

Example. Find the point at which the line of the preceding example crosses 
the x-axis.

The second coordinate of a point on this line is

5 -  2t.

Thus we must find the value for t such that 5 — 2t = 0. This is easily 
solved, and gives t = f . Hence the point at which the line of the preceding 
example crosses the x-axis is

(1,5) - § ( 3 , 2 ) -  ( - i f ,  o ) -

Remark. Suppose that a bug starts from a point P and moves along a 
straight line with a certain speed. We can use a located vector OA, or simply 
A y to represent the velocity of the bug. We interpret OA as representing the 
direction in which the bug is moving, and we interpret | A | (that is, the length 
of OA) as the speed with which the bug is moving. Then at time t the position 
of the bug is given by

P +  tA.

If another bug moves in the same direction, but with three times the speed, 
then at time t the position of the other bug is given by

P +  t • 3A = P +  3tA.

Both bugs will cover the same ground, but the second bug will do so three 
times as fast. Observe that the set of points

{P +  3 tA} t in R  

is the same set as the set of points

{P +  tA} t in R  •



[1 0 , §3] LINES 2 4 1

In intuitive geometry, we assume that two lines which are not parallel 
have exactly one point in common. We now have a means of determining 
this point.

Example. Let two lines be represented parametrically by

(1, 2) +  f(3, 4) and ( -1 ,  1) +  s(2, -1 ) ,

where £, s are the respective parameters. Find the point of intersection of 
these two lines.

We must find the values of s and t such that

1 +  St = - 1  +  2s,
2 +  41 = 1 -  s,

or, in other words,
St — 2s = -2 ,
41 +  s = -1 .

This is a system of two equations in two unknowns which we know how to 
solve from algebra. The solutions are

Hence the common point of the two lines is the point

(1,2) -  £ < 3 , 4) 0
We can also find the point of intersection of a line and other geometric 

figures given by equations.

Example. Find the points of intersection of the line given parametrically 
by

( -1 ,  2) +  t(3, -4 ) ,  t in R,

and the circle
x2 +  y 2 = 4.

The first and second coordinates of points on the line are given by

x (t) = —1 +  31 and y(t) = 2  — 41.

We must find those values of t which are such that x{t) and y(t) satisfy the 
equation of the circle. This means that we must find those values of t such that

( - 1  +  St)2 +  (2  -  4 1)2 = 4 .



2 4 2 SEGMENTS, RAYS, AND LINES [10 , §3]

Expanding out, this amounts to solving for t the equation

1 -  6t +  9t2 +  4 -  16t +  16t2 = 4,

or in other words

25t2 -  22t +  1 = 0.

This is a quadratic equation, which we know how to solve. We obtain:

22 ±  V (22)2 -  4 - 25 - 1
* ~ 50

14 ±  V384 
50

Thus we obtain two values for t. We can simplify slightly, writing 384 = 
4 • 96. The two values for t are then

_ 7 +  V96 
25

and
7 -  V96t = 25

The points of intersection of the line and the circle are then given by (xi, y\) 
and (x2, y 2) where xi, yi, X2, y 2 have the following values:

7 + ̂
y , -  2 — 4 

X2 = —1 + 3  

> 2 = 2 - 4

25
7 +  V96 

25
7 -  V96

7 -  V96

The intersection of the line and the circle can be illustrated as follows. Giving 
t the special values t = 0 and t = 1, we find that the two points

( -1 ,2 )  and (2 ,-2 )

lie on the line. Thus we draw the line passing through these two points, and 
we see it intersect the circle in Fig. 10-12.



[10 , §3] LINES 2 4 3

Fig. 10-12

Example. On the other hand, there may be cases when the line and the 
circle do not intersect. For instance, consider the line given by

( -5 ,0 )  +  f ( l , l ) , t in R.

We wish to determine the points of intersection of this line, and the circle 
having the equation

x2 +  y 2 = 4.

Proceeding as before, we note that the coordinates of the line are given by

x(t) = —5 +  t and y(t) = £.

Substituting these in the equation for the circle, we get an equation for t, 
namely

( - 5  +  t)2 +  t2 = 4,

which expanded out yields

25 -  10i +  t2 +  t2 = 4,

or in other words,

212 -  10i +  21 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula to solve for t gives us

10 ±  VlOO -  168 10 ±  V  —68 
'  "  4 4

We see that the expression under the square root sign is negative, and hence



2 4 4 SEGMENTS, RAYS, AND LINES [1 0 , §3]

there is no real value of t satisfying our equation. This means that the circle 
and the line do not intersect. The situation is illustrated in Fig. 10-13.

To draw the line in this figure, all we need are two points on it. Using 
the special values t = 0, t = 5 shows that the points

are on the line. These points have also been indicated on the figure.

§4. ORDINARY EQUATION FOR A LINE

So far we have described a line in terms of a parameter t. We can 
eliminate this parameter t and get another type of equation for the line. 
We show this by an example.

Example. Let L = {P +  M.}itnR, where P = (3,5) and A = ( —2,7). 
Thus a point (x(t), y(t)) on the line is given by

x = 3 -  2f, y  = 5 +  It.

Multiply the expression for x by 7, multiply the expression for y  by 2, and 
add. We get

7x +  2y = 3 • 7 -  14f +  2 • 5 +  14f 
= 31.

Thus any point (x, y) on the line L satisfies the equation

7x +  2y = 31.

Conversely, let (x, y) be a point satisfying this equation. We want to solve 
for t such that

x  =  3  — 2 1 a n d  y  =  5  +  It.



[10 , §4] ORDINARY EQUATION FOR A LINE 2 4 7

Then certainly x = 3 — 2t. But y  = (31 — 7x)/2. We must verify that

This is obvious by a simple algebraic manipulation, and we have solved for 
the desired t.

We shall call

Similarly, any equation of the form

ax +  by = c

where a, 6, c are numbers, is the equation of a straight line.

§1. RADIAN MEASURE

In a sense, the measurement of angles by degrees is not a natural measure­
ment. It is much more reasonable to take another measure which we now 
describe.

Let 7r be the (numerical value of the) area of a disc of radius 1. The 
approximate value for 7r is 3.14159 . . . .  (Look at our comments about tt in 
Chapter 7, §1.) Let A  be an angle with vertex at P  and let S  be the sector 
determined by A  in the disc D  of radius 1 centered at P. Let x be a number 
between 0 and 2tt. We shall say that

A  has x radians
to mean that

area of S  _  x 
area of D  2ir

Fig. 11-1

2 4 9



250 TRIGONOMETRY [ H ,  §1]

Thus if D is the disc of radius 1 centered at P, our definition is adjusted so 
that the area of the sector S determined by an angle of x radians is x/2; see 
Fig. 11-1. We draw various angles and indicate their radian measure, in 
Fig. 11-2.

y r/ 2

Fig. 11-2

Of course, degrees are related to radians. For instance:
360 degrees = 2ir radians
180 degrees = 7r radians
60 degrees = 7r/3 radians
45 degrees = 7r/4 radians
30 degrees = 7r/6 radians.

In general,
7T 

180 x radians.

However, from now on, unless otherwise specified, we always deal with 
radian measure.

(a) (b)

Fig, 11-3



[11, §1] RADIAN MEASURE 2 5 1

Observe that the length of the circle of radius 1 is 27T. (Cf. Chapter 7.) 
The angle A determines an arc on this circle, and radian measure is so 
adjusted that

length of this arc _  x 
total length of circle 2ir

Thus x is the length of arc determined by A; this is illustrated in Fig. 11-3.
The Greeks realized that they had to choose a constant which appears 

very frequently in mathematics, relating the radius and circumference of a 
circle or its diameter and circumference. The way they chose 7T, however, is 
somewhat inconvenient, because it introduces a factor of 2 in front of ir in 
most of mathematics. It would have been more useful to use the constant c 
such that

area of S _  x 
area of D c

Too late to change, however.
For convenience of language, we shall sometimes speak, incorrectly but 

usefully, of an angle of x radians even if x does not lie between 0 and 2w. 
To do this, we write

x = 2nw +  w,

with a number w such that

0 ^ w < 2ir.

Then, by an angle of x radians, we mean the angle of w radians.
Also for convenience of language, if x is negative, say

x = —z

where 2 is positive, we shall speak of an angle of x radians to mean an angle 
of z radians in the clockwise direction. We draw such an angle in Fig. 11-4.

The positive s-axis is one side of our angle, and the other side is a ray with 
vertex at O. We select a point (a, b) not equal to O on this ray, and we let

r = V a 2 +  b2.



[11, §2] SINE AND COSINE 253

Then r is the distance from (0, 0) to the point (a, b). We define

• - b bsme A = -  = —— ■■
r Va2 +  b2

A CL CLcosine A = -  = -  •
r V  a2 +  b2

If we select another point (ai, 61) on the ray determining our angle A, and 
use its coordinates to get the sine and cosine, then we obtain the same values 
as with (a, b). Indeed, there is a positive number c such that

a\ = ca and 61 = cb.

Hence
6 1 ________cb_____

V  a\ +  b\ V  c2a2 +  c2b2

We can factor c from the denominator, and then cancel c in both the numerator 
and denominator on the right-hand side, to get

b
V a2 +  b2

This proves that our definition of sine A does not depend on the choice of 
coordinates (a, b) on the ray. The proof for the cosine is similar.

The geometric interpretation of the above argument simply states that 
the triangles in Fig. 11-6 are similar, i.e. are obtained by a dilation of each 
other.

Fig. 11-6

In particular, we can select the point (a, b) at any distance from the origin 
that we find convenient. For many purposes, it is convenient to select (a, b)



254 TRIGONOMETRY [11, §2]

on the circle of radius 1, so that r = 1. In that case,
sin A = b and cos A = a.

Consequently, by definition, the coordinates of a point on the circle of radius
1 are

(cos 0, sin 0) 

if 0 is the angle in radians; see Fig. 11-7.

An angle A can be determined by a ray in any one of the four quadrants. 
Fig. 11-8 depicts both the case when the ray is in the second quadrant and 
the case when it is in the third.

When the ray is in the first quadrant, then both the sine and cosine are 
positive because both a and b are positive. When the ray is in the second 
quadrant, then the sine is positive because b is positive. The cosine is negative



[H, §2] SINE AND COSINE 255

because a is negative. When the ray is in the third quadrant, then sine A is 
negative and cosine A is also negative.

It is also convenient to remember the sine in the context of a right triangle. 
Let A be one of the angles in a right triangle, other than the right angle, as 
shown in Fig. 11-9. Let a be the length of the opposite side of A , let b be the 
length of the adjacent side, and let c be the length of the hypotenuse. Then 
we have

a opposite sidesin A = -  = ------ -----------c hypotenuse

Similarly,

We want to define the sine and cosine of a number. Let x be a number. 
We write

x = 2mr +  w 

with some integer n and some number w such that
0 ^ w < 2t .

We then define:
sin x = sine of w radians 
cos x = cosine of w radians.

Thus we have for all numbers x:

sin (x +  27r) = sin x 
cos (x +  2tt) = cos x.

Instead of adding 2iry we could also add any integral multiple of 27r, and find 
the similar property, namely

sin (x +  2mr) = sin x 
cos (x +  2mr) = cos x.



256 TRIGONOMETRY [11, §2]

We can compute a few values of the sine and cosine, as shown in the 
following table.

Number Sine Cosine

7T/4 1/V 2 1/V2
tt/3 V3/2 i2
7T/2 1 0

7T 0 - 1

These can be determined by plane geometry and the Pythagoras theorem. 
For instance, we get the sine of the angle 7r/4 radians from a right triangle 
with two equal legs:

Fig. 11-10

We see that the sine is equal to 1/V2.
Similarly, consider a right triangle whose angles other than the right 

angle have 7r/6 and 7r/3 radians (in other words 30° and 60°, respectively).

Q

In Fig. 11-11, we reflect our triangle A PQM through the side QM and let 
P' be the reflection of P through M. Then APQP' is a triangle all of whose 
angles have the same measure, so that the three sides have equal length. 
Hence c = 2a and

Theorem 7. For any number x, we have

COS X = sin (̂ x +  and sin x = cos (̂ x —

Proof. We may assume that 0 ^ x < 2t . Let A be an angle of x radians, 
let P = (a, b) be a point on the ray which forms one side of A as shown in 
Fig. 11-14 and such that P lies on the circle of radius 1.

P' = (o', bj\ >Q' = (0, a)

P = (a, b)

t Fie. 11-14
0 Q = (a, 0)

Let Q = (a, 0). Let G be rotation by an angle of ir/2. Let P' = G(P) and 
Q' = G(Q). Then Q' = (0, a). If P = Q, then the first formula is clear. 
If P Q, then the segment PQ is perpendicular to the first axis, and hence 
P'Q' is perpendicular to the second axis. Hence the second coordinate of Q' 
is a, in other words, we have b' = a. Since we took P on the circle of radius 1, 
it follows that

cos x = a and sin = 6'.

This proves the first formula. The second is proved similarly, and we leave 
it to you.

Theorem 2. For all numbers x, we have

sin ( — x) = — sin x and cos ( — x) = cos x.

Proof. This comes from looking at Fig. 11-15 and using the definition 
of the sine and cosine. If (a, b) is a point on the ray corresponding to an 
angle of x radians, then (a, —6) is a point on the ray corresponding to an 
angle of — x radians.



[11, §2] SINE AND COSINE 259

We can take (a, b) on the circle of radius 1, in which case
\

sin x = b and cos x = a.

Our assertion is then clear.

The sine and cosine have various applications. We give one example.

Example. A boat B starts from a point P on a straight river and moves 
down the river. An observer O stands at a distance of 1,000 ft from P, on 
the line perpendicular to the river passing through P. After 10 min, the 
observer finds that the angle 6 formed by P, himself, and the boat, is such 
that cos 6 = 0.7. What is the distance between the observer and the boat 
at that time?

Picture first:

We want to find c. We have

We don’t care here if you compute the decimal or not.
Remark. The whole point in this example is that the angle 0 can be deter­
mined with a very small-sized instrument. The distance d(0, P) of course 
must be measured, but both O, P are fixed so there is no difficulty in that.

Polar coordinates
Referring to Fig. 11-17, let (x, y) be a point in the plane. We can 

describe this point by using other coordinates. Let

r = V  x2 +  y 2.

Thus (x, y) lies at distance r from the origin. Then by definition we have

x y-  = cos 0 and -  = sin 0 r r

for some number 0, provided that r ^ 0. We can rewrite these in the form

x = r cos 6 and y  = r sin 6,

and since we don’t divide by r, these are valid whether r = 0 or not.



[11, §2] SINE AND COSINE 2 6 1

We call (r, 0) polar coordinates for the point (x,y). When we deal 
simultaneously with polar coordinates and the other coordinates (x, y), then 
we call (x, y) the Cartesian, or rectangular coordinates.

Example. Find polar coordinates for the point whose rectangular co­
ordinates are (1, VS).

We have x = 1 and y = VS, so that

We see that 0 = 7r/3, and that the polar coordinates for the point are (2, 7r/3). 
According to our convention, we note that if (r, 0) are polar coordinates for 
a point, then (r, 6 +  2t ) are also polar coordinates. Thus in our example, 
our given point also has polar coordinates given by

In practice, we usually select the value of 0 such that 0 ^ 0 < 2ir.

Example. Given numbers a, b such that a2 +  b2 = 1, we can always find 
a number 6 such that a = cos 6 and b = sin 6. Therefore the point whose 
rectangular coordinates are (a, b) has polar coordinates (1, 0) for such 0. 
If a is positive, then — tt/2 < 0 < t /2,  and our choice of 0 is restricted to 
two possibilities as shown in Fig. 11-18.

r = V  1 + 3  = 2.

The number a must lie between 0 and 1 because a2 ^ 1. The angle of 0 
radians is determined by the point of intersection of the circle of radius 1 
centered at the origin, and the line through the point (a, 0), perpendicular to 
the x-axis. Now depending on whether 6 is positive or negative, we eliminate 
one of the two possibilities for 0; namely, we take 0 positive if b is positive, 
and 0 negative if b is negative, such that sin 0 = 6.

When a is negative, we argue in a similar way.

Example. Let a =  ̂ and 6 = — V3/2. Then a2 +  62 = 1. In this case, 
illustrated in Fig. 11-19, we take 0 = — 7r/3.

§3. THE GRAPHS

We consider the values of sin x when x goes from 0 to 2 t . We take a 
circle of radius 1 centered at the origin, and determine sin x from a point 
(a, b) on this circle, as in Fig. 11-21.



[1 1 , §3] THE GRAPHS 2 6 5

Fig. 11-21

Then
sin x = b.

We start with sin 0 = 0. As x goes from 0 to 7r/2, the sine of x increases 
(namely b increases) until x reaches 7r/2, at which point the sine is equal to 1.

As x ranges from tt/2 to 7r, the sine decreases until it becomes sin it = 0.
As x ranges from 7r to 37T/2, the sine becomes negative, but otherwise 

behaves in a way similar to the sine in the first quadrant. The sine in this 
range decreases until it reaches

sin 37T/2 = — 1.

Finally, as x goes from 37T/2 to 27r, the sine of x goes from —1 to 0 and 
increases.

At this point we are ready to start all over again.
It is interesting to plot the points whose coordinates are

(jc, sin x).

The set of points in the plane having these coordinates is called the graph 
of the sine. According to the preceding remarks, we see that the graph of 
the sine looks approximately as in Fig. 11-22.

g) y = cos ( - x), h) y = sin 5x,

c) y = cos 2x,
f) y = cos 4x,
i) y = cos 5x.

§4. THE TANGENT

We define the tangent of an angle A to be

cos A

This is defined only when cos A ^ 0, and therefore is defined for angles 
other than ir/2 radians or Sir/2 radians.

Similarly, we define
sin xtan x = ------ >cos x

whenever x is a number which is not of the form

2 +  n7r’

and n is an integer. We let you make a table of values for tan x when x 
ranges over the usual simple numbers, multiples of 7r/4 or multiples of 7r/6.

Suppose that the angle A is defined by the positive x-axis and a ray as 
before. We select a point (a, b) on the ray as before. Then

tan A = -  • a

This is seen at once by taking the quotient of b/r and a/r: the r cancels.



[1 1 , §4] THE TANGENT 2 6 7

Remark. If you read about the slope of a straight line in the next chapter, 
you will observe that the tangent of the angle which the line makes with the 
jc-axis is precisely its slope. For instance, if the line is given by the equation

y = -3x,

then the tangent of this angle is —3, as shown in Fig. 11-23(b). We see this 
by picking a point on the line, say (1, —3) and then using the definition of 
the tangent.

Example. If A is the angle as indicated in Fig. 11-24 (a), in a 3, 4, 5 right 
triangle, then

tan A = -  •o
We also have

tan = Vs.o

(a) (b) Fig. 11-24



2 6 8 TRIGONOMETRY [1 1 , §4]

Example. Determine all possible values of cos x given that tan x = 2.
To do this, first note that tan x is negative when x lies between t t /2 and 

7T, and also when x lies between Stt/2 and 2ir. On the other hand, the tangent 
is positive for other values of x, and there will be two possible values of x 
such that tan x = 2, as shown in Fig. 11-25 (a) and (b).

These values correspond to right triangles whose legs have lengths 1 and 2, 
respectively. Therefore the hypotenuse has length V5. In the case of 
Fig. 11-25(a), it follows that

and in the case of Fig. 11-25(b), it follows that
1

COS X = --------- 3  •
V5

These are the desired values.

We can draw the graph of the tangent just as easily as the graph of sine 
or cosine. We use a table of values for a few points, and also take into account 
the manner in which the tangent increases or decreases. For instance, when 
x goes from 0 to 7r/2, we note that sin x increases from 0 to 1, while cos x 
decreases from 1 to 0. Hence 1 /cos x increases, starting with the value 1 
when x = 0 and becoming arbitrarily large. Thus finally

tan x = sin x -----—cos x
increases, starting with the value 0 when x = 0, and becomes arbitrarily 
large. A similar discussion for other intervals shows us that the graph of the 
tangent looks like this.



[1 1 , §4] THE TANGENT 2 6 9

The tangent is more practical than the sine or cosine for many purposes.

Example. Suppose we want to determine the height of a tower without 
climbing the tower. We go a distance a from the tower, as shown on Fig. 11-27.

The distance a is known, and we wish to determine the height y. We can 
determine the angle A easily with any mechanical device available for that 
purpose. We can then look up the tangent, tan A, in tables. Since

-  = tan A, a

we can then solve for y , namely y  = a • tan A.
For instance, suppose that the distance a is equal to 100 ft and that the 

angle A has ir/S radians. Then

tan = V s f o

and hence the height of the tower is equal to

lOOVcl ft.

§5. ADDITION FORMULAS

Our main results are the addition formulas for sine and cosine.

Theorem 3. For any angles A, B> we have

sin (A +  B) = sin A cos B +  cos A sin B 
cos (A +  B) = cos A cos B — sin A sin B.

Proof. We shall prove the second formula first.
We consider two angles A, B and their sum:

Fig. 11-29

We take two points P, Q as indicated in Fig. 11-29, at a distance 1 from the 
origin O. We shall compute the distance from P to Q, using two different 
coordinate systems. First we take a coordinate system as usual, illustrated 
in Fig. 11-30.

Fig. 11-30

Then the coordinates of P are (1,0) and those of Q are

(cos(A +  B), sin(A +  B)).

The square of the distance between P and Q is

sin2 (A +  B) +  (cos(A +  B) — l ) 2,

which is equal to sin2(A +  B) +  cos2(A +  B) — 2 cos(A +  B) +  1, and 
hence equal to

— 2 cos(A +  B) +  2.

Next we place the coordinate system as shown in Fig. 11-31.



[1 1 , §5] ADDITION FORMULAS 2 7 3

y-axis

Fig. 11-31

Then the coordinates of P become

(cos A, sin( —A)) = (cos A, —sin A).

Those of Q are simply (cos B, sin B). The square of the distance between P 
and Q is equal to

(sin B +  sin A)2 +  (cos B — cos A )2,

which is equal to

sin2 B +  2 sin B sin A +  sin2 A +  cos2 B — 2 cos B cos A +  cos2 A
= 2 +  2 sin A sin B — 2 cos A cos B.

If we set the squares of the two distances equal to each other, then we get 
the desired addition formula for the cosine.

The addition formula for the sine can be obtained by the following 
device, using Theorem 2:

sin (A +  B) = cos ( A +  B

= cos

0 + B-f)
A cos — sin A sin  ̂B —

(i - b)= cos A sin B +  sin A sin I

= cos A sin B +  sin A cos B. 

This proves the addition formula for the sine.

Corollary. For any numbers jc ,  y , we have:

out the details in full.

Remark. Among all the formulas for sine and cosine, you should remember 
those of Theorem 3, and the following ones:

SC 1. sin2 x +  cos2 x = 1,
SC 2. cos(— x) = cos jc,
SC 3. sin(— x) = — sin jc,

Read these out loud and get an aural memory of them. All other formulas 
are immediate consequences of these, and can be derived each time you 
need them. Experience shows that this is the most economical use of your 
brain in dealing with these formulas.

Example. Find sin(7r/12).

We know all the values on the right-hand side, and a simple computation 
shows that

From Theorem 3 we can also easily prove four other formulas which are 
used quite frequently and which should be memorized. They are:

SC 6. sin 2 jc =  2  sin x cos jc,
SC 7. cos 2jc = cos2 jc — sin2 jc,

We write

You should have fun carrying out the easy proofs, and we leave them to you 
as Exercise 4. We shall now see how to use these formulas in examples to 
compute new values for the sine and cosine.

Example. Suppose that x is a number such that

To find sin 2x we use formula SC 6. Note that

cos x = V 1 — sin2 x = Vl — 0.64 = V 0.36 = 0.6.

We took the positive square root because we prescribed that x should lie 
between 0 and 7r /2, so that cos x must be positive. Applying SC 6 now yields

sin 2x = 2 sin x cos x = 2 (0.8) (0.6) = 0.96.

Example. We wish to compute cos w/8. Let us use SC 8, with x = 7r/8. 
We know cos 2x, namely

To put this into decimal form, it is easier to use a computing machine than 
your brain, and we leave the answer in the correct form above.

Example. To find sin tt/8 we use SC 1, and the value for cos 7r/8 which we 
have just determined. Thus we obtain

sin x = 0.8 and 0 < x < -  •

7r 1cos — = —-

§6. ROTATIONS

We have not yet investigated rotations from the point of view of co­
ordinates, and we now fill this gap. We ask the basic question: Given a point 
P with coordinates (x,y), let G*, be the rotation with respect to the origin 
O = (0, 0) by an angle of <p radians. Let

G,(P) = P' =
How do we describe the coordinates (*', y r) of Pf in terms of those of P? 
The answer is quite simple, and we shall use polar coordinates, as well as the 
addition formula, to get this answer.



2 7 8 TRIGONOMETRY [U, §6]

Let (r, 0) be the polar coordinates of P. Then the polar coordinates of 
the point P' are simple (r, 0 +  <p).

On the other hand, we know that

x = r cos 0, xf = r cos(0 +  <p), 

y = r sin 0, y' = r sin(0 +  <p).

We use the addition formula for the sine and cosine on the expressions on 
the right, and find

Expanding this out, and using the expression for x, y  in terms of r, cos 6 
and sin 0, we find:

Thus rotation by an angle of y? radians is described by the four numbers

Fig. 11-32

x’ = r[cos 0 cos ^ — sin 0 sin <p], 

y f = /'[sin 0 cos y? +  sin <p cos 0].

x’ = (cos <p)x — (sin <p)y, 
y' = (sin <p)x +  (cos <p)y.



[11, §6] ROTATIONS 2 7 9

An array of numbers like

(: 2)
has a technical name: It is called a matrix (in fact a 2 X 2 matrix). 

Example. For instance,

e ‘0
is a 2 X 2 matrix.

Example. The matrix associated with the rotation GT/2 is the matrix

/cos 7r/2 —sin 7r/2\ /0  —1\ 
\sin 7r/2 cos 7r/2/ \1 0 /

If (*, y) are the coordinates of a point P, then the coordinates of the point 
P' obtained by rotating P by an angle of 7r/2 are

* '  =  — y ,

y' = x.

The boxed formula for the coordinates (jc', y') in terms of (re, y) is some­
times written in the form of a “ product” ,

(
cos v? —sin <p\f x\ _  ( x'\ 
sin <p cos <p)\y) ~ \y'J

This is something like a multiplication. 
In general, if

(  3 2 \ / = (  *x +  2y\

72 Some Analytic Geometry

§1. THE STRAIGHT LINE AGAIN

Let F(x, y) be an expression involving a pair of numbers (x, y). Let c be 
a number. We consider the equation

F(x, y) = c.

The set of points (x, y) for which this equation holds is called the graph of 
the equation. In this section we study the simplest case of equations like

Sx — 2y = 5.

If you have read Chapter 10, you already know this equation, but we shall 
not assume any knowledge from this chapter. We develop everything from 
scratch.

Consider first a simple example, namely

y  = 3x.

The set of points (x, 3x) is the graph of this equation, or equivalently of the 
equation

y -  Sx = 0.

We can give x an arbitrary value, and thus we see that the graph looks 
like Fig. 12-1 (a).

281



282 SOME ANALYTIC GEOMETRY [12, §1]

If we consider the graph of

y =

we see that it is a line which slants more steeply. In general, the graph of the 
equation

y  = ax,

where a is a number, represents a straight line. An arbitrary point on this 
line is of type

(x, ax) = x(l, a).

Thus the (x, y) coordinates of a point on the line are obtained by making 
the dilation of (1, a) by x.

If a is positive, then the line slants to the right. If a is negative, then the 
line slants to the left, as shown on Fig. 12-1 (b). For instance, the graph of

y  = - x

consists of all points (x, —x), and looks like this (Fig. 12-2).



[12, §1] THE STRAIGHT LINE AGAIN 2 8 3

Fig. 12-2

If we drop the perpendiculars from the point (x, —x) to the axes, we obtain 
a right triangle, which in this case has legs of equal length.

Let a, b be numbers. The graph of the equation

(1) y  = ax +  b

is also a straight line, which is parallel to the graph of the equation

(2) y = ax.

To convince ourselves of this, we observe the following. Let

y' = y  -  b.

The equation
(3) y  = ax

is of the type just discussed. If we have a point (x, y') on the graph of (3), 
then we get a point (x, y f +  b) on the graph of (1), simply by adding b to the 
second coordinate. This means that the graph of the equation

y  = ax +  b

is the straight line parallel to the line determined by the equation

y = ax,

and passing through the point (0, b).

Example. We want to draw the graph of the equation

y  = 2x +  1.



2 8 4 SOME ANALYTIC GEOMETRY [12, §1]

When x = 0, then y = 1. When y = 0, then x = — \ 
looks like Fig. 12-3(a).

Example. We want to draw the graph of the equation

y  = - 2 x  -  5.

When x = 0, then y  = —5. When y  = 0, then x = — 
looks like Fig. 12-3 (b).

(b)

f . Hence the graph

Fig. 12-3 (cont.)



[12, §1] THE STRAIGHT LINE AGAIN 285

If a line L is the graph of the equation

y  = ax +  b,

then we call the number a the slope of the line. For instance, the slope of 
the line whose equation is

y = —4x +  7 

is —4. The slope determines how the line is slanted.
Let y = ax +  b be the equation of a line.
The slope of this line can be obtained from two distinct points on the 

line. Let (xi, y{) and (x2, y 2) be the two points. By definition, we know that

yi = ax i +  b, 
y 2 = ax 2 +  b.

Subtracting, we find that

y 2 -  yi = a(x2 -  xi).

Consequently, if the two points are distinct, x2 ^ x\, and we can divide by 
(x2 — jci) to find

_ y 2 -  y  ia = -----------•
*2 -  *1

This formula gives us the slope in terms of the coordinates of two distinct 
points.

Example. Consider the line defined by the equation

y  = 2* +  5.

The two points (1, 7) and ( — 1, 3) lie on the line. The slope is equal to 2, 
and, in fact,

as it should be.

Geometrically, our quotient
y2 -  yi 
x2 ~  *1

is the ratio of the vertical side and horizontal side of the triangle in Fig. 12-4.



2 8 6 SOME ANALYTIC GEOMETRY [12, §1]

Observe that it does not matter which point we call (x\,y{) and which 
one we call (X2, y 2)- We would get the same value for the slope. This is 
because if we invert their order, then in the quotient expressing the slope 
both the numerator and denominator will change by a sign, so that their 
quotient does not change.

Conversely, given two points, it is easy to determine the equation of the 
line passing through the two points.

Example. Find the equation of the line passing through the points (1, 2) 
and (2, —1).

We first find the slope. It must be the quotient
y2 ~ y  i 
*2 -  *1

which in this case is equal to

Thus we know that our line is the graph of the equation

y = — 3x +  6

for some number b, which we must determine. We know that the line passes 
through the point (1, 2). Hence

2 = - 3 - 1  +  6,

and we get the value of b, namely

6 =  5 .



[12, §1] THE STRAIGHT LINE AGAIN 2 8 7

Thus the equation of the line is

y  = -3 *  +  5.
We can also determine the equation of a line given the slope and one 

point.

Example. Find the equation of the line having slope —7 and passing through 
the point ( — 1, 2).

The equation must be of the form
y = - I x  +  b

with some number b. Furthermore, when x = — 1 the corresponding value 
of y  must be 2. Hence

2 = ( —7)( —1) +  b,

and
b = -5 .

Hence the equation of the line is

y = - l x  -  5.

In general, the equation of the line passing through the point (xi,;yi) 
and having slope a  is

y -  y\ =  a ( x  -  Xi ) .

For points such that x ^ x\, we can also write this in the form

X — X\

The equation of the line passing through two points (xu y i) and fa, y 2) is

y -  yi II to 1
X1X

* 2  -  *1

for all points such that x x\.

We should also mention vertical lines. These cannot be represented by 
equations of type

y  =  ax +  b.



2 8 8 SOME ANALYTIC GEOMETRY [12, §1]

Suppose that we have a vertical line intersecting the Jt-axis at the point (2, 0). 
The y-coordinate of any point on the line can be an arbitrary number, while 
the Jt-coordinate is always 2. Hence the equation of this line is simply

jc =  2 .

Similarly, the equation of a  vertical line intersecting the J t - a x i s  at the point 
(c, 0) is

X =  c.

When a line is given in the form y  = ax +  b, it is easy to find its inter­
section with a circle. We give an example.

Example. Find the points of intersection of the line and the circle given by 
the following equations:

y =  Sx +  2 and x2 +  y 2 =  1.

To do this, note that a point (jc , y) lies on the intersection if and only if 
y  = 3x +  2 and

jc2 +  (3jc +  2)2 =  1.

Thus we must solve for jc in this last equation, which is equivalent to

jc2 +  9jc2 +  12jc +  4 =  1.

Again, this equation is equivalent to

IOjc2 +  12jc +  3 = 0,

which we can solve by the quadratic formula. We find

-1 2  =fc Vl44 - 4 - 3 0
*  " ---------------------------------20-------------------------------- ’

or in other words, we find the two values

- 6  ±  V6  
X 10

These two possible values for jc give us the two points of intersection, as 
illustrated in Fig. 12-5(a). The y-coordinates can be found by the expression 
y  = 3jc +  2, and hence the points of intersection are

/ - 6  +  V6 2 +  3^6\ , /  —6 -  V& 2 -  3V6\
V----- 10—  ’ ■ 10 )  “ d ------2--------------10—



[12, §1] THE STRAIGHT LINE AGAIN 289

Of course, it may happen that a circle and a line do not intersect, as shown 
in Fig. 12-5 (b). If we followed the same procedure to solve for x as before, 
we would find in this case that the quadratic equation has no real solution 
because the number under the square root sign is negative.

Example. Find the points of intersection (if any) of the line and the circle 
given by the following equations:

y  = x +  5 and x2 +  y 2 = 1.

We follow the same procedure as before, and we see that the jc-coordinate 
of a point of intersection must satisfy the equation

x2 +  (x +  5)2 = 1,

or equivalently
jc2 +  jc2 +  10* +  25 = 1.

This amounts to solving
2jc2 +  IOjc +  24 = 0.

The quadratic formula gives

-1 0  dz VlOO -  192 -1 0  dz V — 92
* “  4 4

In this case, the number under the square root sign is negative, and hence 
there is no real solution. Hence the circle and the line do not intersect.

§2. THE PARABOLA

Next we consider the graph of the equation



292 SOME ANALYTIC GEOMETRY [12, §2]

In this case, we see that for any value of x, the corresponding value of y  is 
positive. We make a small table of values.

We see that as x increases, so does x2. Furthermore ( — x)2 = x2. Thus our 
graph (x, x2) is symmetric with respect to the y-axis. It looks like this.

Fig. 12-6

Suppose that we want to draw the graph of the equation

(1) y = (x -  l ) 2.

We shall find that it looks exactly the same, but as if the origin were placed 
at the point (1, 0). (See Fig. 12-7.) Namely, let

x' = x -  1.

Then our equation (1) is equivalent to

(2) y = x'2.



[12, §2] THE PARABOLA 2 9 3

Thus if we place our coordinate system with origin at the point (1,0), we see 
that equation (1) becomes equation (2) in terms of the new coordinates 
(jc', y). Similarly, the equation

y = (* -  a)2

has a graph which looks like the 
others, but translated to (a, 0).

We can also perform a trans­
lation on y. Let (a, b) be a given 
point. We let

and y' = y -  b.

Thus when x = a, we have x' = 0 
and when y = b, we have y' = 0. 
As we can see in Fig. 12-8, the 
graph of the equation

y' = jc'2

looks the same as the graph of the 
equation y  = jc2, but translated to 
the point (a, b).



294 SOME ANALYTIC GEOMETRY [12, §2]

Note that the equation y' = x'2 is the same as the equation

(y -  b) = (x -  a)2

in terms of the coordinates (x, y).
A curve which has an equation

(y -  b) = c(x -  a)2

in some coordinate system is called a parabola.

Example. Describe the graph of the equation

2y — x2 — 4x +  6 = 0.

We complete the square in x. We can write

x2 +4x = (x +  2)2 — 4.

Hence our equation can be rewritten

2y = (x +  2)2 -  10,
or

2(y +  5) = (x +  2)2.

Choosing the new coordinates
x' = x +  2 and y' = y  +  5, 

our graph is defined in terms of these coordinates by the equation

y' = i* '2,

which is easily drawn as in Fig. 12-9.



[1 2 , §2] THE PARABOLA 295

or

Finally, we remark that if we have an equation

x -  y 2 = 0

x = y 2,
then we get the graph of a curve which is also called a parabola, and is tilted 
horizontally as in Fig. 12-10.

Fig. 12-10

In this case, all values of x are positive when y  5* 0 because then y 2 > 0.
We can apply the same technique of changing the coordinate system to 

see what the graph of a more general equation looks like.

Example. Sketch the graph of the equation
x -  y 2 +  2y +  5 = 0 .

After completing the square in y, we can write this equation in the form

(x +  6) = (y -  l ) 2, 

and hence its graph looks like this (Fig. 12-11).



296 SOME ANALYTIC GEOMETRY [1 2 , §2]

We don’t go into further properties of the parabola. However, we 
mention one of them here which shows how parabolas arise in optics. If one 
makes a mirror in the shape of a parabola, then any horizontal ray coming 
into the mirror gets reflected, and all these reflections meet at one point, 
called the focus F  of the parabola. We have drawn this in Fig. 12-12.

Of course, if the parabola is given by an equation, we want a means of deter­
mining the coordinates of the focus. This belongs in a special course in analytic 
geometry, or optics, and we don’t cover it here in our general survey of basic 
mathematics. A similar remark holds for other properties of the various 
curves discussed in this chapter (ellipse and hyperbola, in addition to the 
parabola). They have a number of interesting properties which are tradition­
ally covered at this elementary level. However, I feel that it is best to post­
pone the discussion of such properties to the time when they are needed. 
All we are trying to do here is to get a quick acquaintance with the graphs of 
simple curves defined by simple equations. This is more than sufficient 
background to do calculus and many other applications (in physics, engi­
neering, or economics).

§3. THE ELLIPSE

Let a be a positive number. If (x, y) is a point in the plane, then we call 
the point

(ax, ay)

the dilation of (x, y) by a. Multiplication of each coordinate by a amounts to 
stretching by a.



298 SOME ANALYTIC GEOMETRY [12, §3]

We can generalize this slightly. Let a, b be positive numbers. To each 
point (jc, y) we associate the point (ax, by). Thus we stretch the first co­
ordinate by a and the second coordinate by b. The association

(x, y) »-> (ax, by)

will be denoted by F a,b-

Consider the circle consisting of all points (jc, y) such that

( 1 )  jc 2 +  y 2 = 1.

It is the unit circle centered at the origin. What happens to this circle when 
we impose on it this mixed type of dilation? Let

and
u = ax

v = by.

Then u, v satisfy the equation
2 2 u v

*  +  P  =

Conversely, if (u, v) is a point satisfying this equation, letting
u

x = — a
and

u
y  = b

shows that (u, v) is the image of (jc, y) under F a,b- Hence the image of the 
circle defined by equation (1) is the set of points (u, v) satisfying equation
(2). This image is called an ellipse. In general, an ellipse is a curve in the 
plane which is the graph of an equation of type (2) in some coordinate system.

Example. The set of points (u, v) satisfying the equation

2 2 u v
—  -|---------- =  1
32 22

is an ellipse. We wish to draw its graph. Call the horizontal axis the u-axis, 
and the vertical axis the i;-axis. When u = 0, we see that v2 = 22 so that 
v = d z 2 .  When v = 0, we see that u2 = 32 so that u = ±3. If we visualize 
the circle of radius 1 undergoing the mixed stretching F % t2, then we see that 
the graph of the ellipse looks like this (Fig. 12-13).



[12, §3] THE ELLIPSE 299

Fig. 12-13

We can also perform a translation on an ellipse just as we did for circles 
and parabolas.

Example. Draw the graph of the ellipse defined by the equation

(x -  l ) 2 (y -  4)2 =
25 16

Let xf = x — 1 and y' = y  — 4. Then (x'y y') satisfy the equation

52 ^  42
Thus we have the equation of an ellipse centered at the point (1, 4), as shown 
in Fig. 12-14.

13. Find the points of intersection of the ellipses given in Exercises 1 through 
12 with the straight line given by the equation y  = 2x — 1.

§4. THE HYPERBOLA

We wish to graph the equation

xy = 1.

First observe that if x, y  satisfy this equation, they cannot be equal to 0. 
We can solve for y  in terms of x, namely



[12, §4] THE HYPERBOLA 301

We make a small table of values.

X y * y

1 i i 2
2 i  i 3
3 i  i 4

100 1100

We see that as x grows larger, y  grows smaller. Also we have an obvious 
symmetry when x takes on negative values. Thus the graph looks like this 
(Fig. 12-15).

Fig. 12-15

Similarly, we can perform a translation as we did before. 

Example. Sketch the graph of the equation

1
y  -  2 =

x -J- 3

Let x' = x +  3 and y' = y  — 2. Then the coordinates x', y' satisfy 
the equation

x'y' = 1.



Thus our graph looks like this (Fig. 12-16).

302 SOME ANALYTIC GEOMETRY [12, §4]

y' y

If c is a number, we can graph in a similar way the equation xy = c. A curve 
which has an equation of type xy = c in some coordinate system is called a 
hyperbola.

Example. If we are given an equation like

xy -  2x +  3y +  4 = 5, 

then we can factor the left-hand side and rewrite the equation as 

(x +  3)(y -  2) +  6 +  4 = 5,
or

(x +  3)(y -  2) = -5 .

In terms of the new coordinates x' = x +  3 and y' = y  — 2, we can rewrite 
our equation in the form

x y  = -5 .

Using a table of values, and a similar analysis of what happens to y' when x' 
increases or decreases, we see that the graph looks like this (Fig. 12-17).



[12, §4] THE HYPERBOLA 303

y' y

Example. In physics we encounter cases where an object is repelled from 
the origin along a straight line, with a force whose magnitude is inversely 
proportional to the distance from the origin. Suppose this straight line is the 
jc-axis. Let y  be the magnitude of the force acting on the particle. Then we 
can write

for some constant k. For instance, we can take k — 2. We can then draw 
the graph of the force, which is similar to a hyperbola. We make a small 
table of values to get an idea of the behavior of the curve.

The next section is slightly less important than the preceding one, and may 
be omitted.

§5. ROTATION OF HYPERBOLAS

There is another standard equation for a hyperbola which occurs fre­
quently, and which it is useful to recognize, namely, the equation

(1) y 2 — x2 = 1,
or more generally, the equation

y 2 -  x2 = c,

with some constant c. We shall now see that these equations represent



306 SOME ANALYTIC GEOMETRY [12, §5]

hyperbolas, obtained by rotating the hyperbola defined by our standard 
equation

xy = 1,

and then perhaps performing a dilation.

Theorem 1. Let H  be the set of points (x, y) satisfying the equation

xy = 1.

Let G be rotation by 7r/4, counterclockwise, as usual. Then the image of H  
under G is the curve H f consisting of all points (u, v) satisfying the equation

(2) u2 — u2 = 2.

We may illustrate Theorem 1 in Fig. 12-19.

(a) (1)) Fig. 12-19

Fig. 12-19 (b) represents the hyperbola of Fig. 12-19 (a) rotated counter­
clockwise by 7r/4. We have also drawn the axes of Fig. 12-19(a), rotated 
by 7r/4.

Proof of Theorem 1. We recall that under rotation by an angle, 0, the 
coordinates of a point (x, y) change by the matrix



[12, §5] ROTATION OF HYPERBOLAS 307

(Cf. Chapter 11, §6.) This means that if (u, v) are the coordinates of the 
rotated point, then

u = (cos 6)x — (sin 6)y 

u = (sin 6)x +  (cos B)y.

We apply this when 6 = 7r/4, in which case we have

• „ 1cos 0 = sin 0 = —-  •
V2

We then see that the coordinates of the rotated point (a, v) are given by

1 1 1 / Nu =  — x -------— y  =  —  {x -  y)V2 V  2 a/2
(3) 1 1 1v = — x +  — y = —  (x +  y).

V2 V  2 V  2
Furthermore, we get:

2 2 1 / i \ 2 1 / \ 2 V -  u =  -  (x +  y) -  -  (x -  y)

= | [x2 +  2xy +  y2 -  (x2 -  2xy +  y2)]

=
If a point (jc, y) satisfies the condition xy  = 1, we conclude that its image 
(a, v) satisfies the equation

v2 — u2 =  2.

Hence we have proved that the image of H  is contained in the curve H'. 
In other words, we have proved that if (x, y)  satisfies (1), then its rotation 
by 7r/4 satisfies (2).

Conversely, let P' = (a, v) be a point satisfying (2), i.e. such that
v2 — u2 =  2.

We must show that P' = G(P) for some point P = (x, y)  satisfying (1). 
Our intuition immediately tells us how to find (x, y ) : these coordinates are 
obtained by rotating (u, v) through an angle of — 7r/4. Thus we let

X =  -^— (u +  v)
V2

y = - 7 : ( - u  +  v).V2



308 SOME ANALYTIC GEOMETRY [12, §5]

Taking the product, we find that

xy = h(u +  v)(v — u) = \{v2 — u2) =  1.

If you now use formulas (3) applied to this point (x, y), you will find precisely 
that they yield (a, v). This proves what we wanted, and concludes the proof 
of Theorem 1.
Remark. Instead of rotating the hyperbola defined by the equation xy = 1, 
suppose that we rotate the hyperbola represented by the equation

xy = 6.

Denote this hyperbola by Ĥ Jq. It is obtained from H  by a dilation, namely, 
we can rewrite our equation in the form

\ /  6 \ /  6

Let x' = x /y /6  and y' = y /y /6 .  Then (x',yf) satisfy the equation

x y  = 1.
We also have

x = y /6  • xf and y  = \/r6 • y'.

Thus H tJ~q is the dilation by V 6  of the hyperbola H.

In general, let r be a positive number. The same argument shows that 
the hyperbola Hr represented by the equation

xy = r2

is the dilation by r of the hyperbola H  = H\.
Let G be any rotation. For any positive number r, and any point P, we 

note that
G(rP) = rG(P).

In other words, dilating by r followed by the rotation G is the same as first 
taking the rotation G and then dilating by r. We could say that a rotation 
commutes with a dilation. We then see that rotating the hyperbola Hr by 
7r/4 yields the hyperbola defined by the equation

v2 — u2 = 2 r2.

Example. The hyperbola
v2 — u2 = 18



[12, §5] ROTATION OF HYPERBOLAS 309

is the rotation by 7r/4 of the hyperbola defined by the equation

xy = 9.

Example. The hyperbola
v2 — u2 = 10

is the rotation by 7r/4 of the hyperbola represented by the equation

xy = 5.

(Watch out: We have 10 = 2 • 5, so that we use r = \/5.)

Remark. When sketching the graph of a hyperbola with an equation like

v2 — u2 = 10,

it is useful to note the point at which u = 0, i.e. the points where the hyper­
bola meets the vertical axis. The ^-coordinates of these points satisfy

v2 = 10,

or in other words,
v = \/To or v = —V 10.

Thus the graph of this equation can be sketched as in Fig. 12-20.

MISCELLANEOUS





13 Functions

§1. DEFINITION OF A FUNCTION

A function, defined for all numbers, is an association which to each 
number associates another number. If we denote a function by /, then this 
association is denoted by

We call f  (x) the value of the function at x, or the image of x under /. 

Example. The association
/: x x2

is a function called the square. Similarly, the association

g: x x +  1

is a function. We have /(2) = 4, /(3) = 9, / (  — l) = 1 and / ( — 2) = 4. 
We have g(l) = 2, *(2) = 3, *(50) = 51.

Example. If you have read the chapter on trigonometry, then you now see 
that the association

x h-> sin x

is a function, which we already called the sine.

Example. The association which to each number x associates the number
4 is called the constant function, with constant value 4. Similarly, if c 
is a given number, the association

x y- > c, for all numbers x

is called the constant function with value c.

313



314 FUNCTIONS [13, §1]

Remark on terminology. We have adopted the convention that the values 
of a function are numbers. Although this is not a universal convention, I 
find it useful. For an analogous notion when other types of values are allowed, 
see mappings in the next chapter.

We would like to say that the square root is also a function, but we know 
that negative numbers do not have real square roots. Thus we extend our 
definition of function as follows.

Let S be a set of numbers. A function defined on S is an association 
which to each element of S associates a number.

Example. Let S be the set of numbers ^ 0. Then the square root is a 
function defined on S. Its value at 4 is 2. Its value at 10 is VlO.

Example. Let S be the set of numbers ^  0. Let f  be the function defined 
on S such that

/<«) -  i

for all x in S. Then / ( l )  = 1, /(2) = J, /(100) = ^  and /(§) = §. 

Example. Let n be a positive integer. Then the association

is a function, which we called the n-th power.

Warning. It is very convenient sometimes to use slightly incorrect language. 
Often you will find written a sentence like:

“ Let f(x) be such and such a function.”

The trouble here is that there is no quantification of x. What one means in 
that case, is the function whose value at a number x is such and such. We 
shall try to avoid incorrect language at least at the beginning of our discussion.

The preceding examples of functions have been given by formulas. 
Functions can, of course, be defined quite arbitrarily.

Example. Let G be the function such that
G(x) = 0 if x is a rational number,
G(x) = 1 if x is not a rational number.

Then in particular, G(2) = G(§) = G( —f) = 0, but

G (V  2) = 1.



[13, §1] DEFINITION OF A FUNCTION 315

To describe a function amounts to giving its values at all numbers for 
which it is defined.

Let f, g be functions defined on the same set S. We can define the sum 
f  +  g of the two functions to be the function whose value at an element x 
of S is

f(x) +  g(x).

Then associativity for addition of numbers gives us associativity for addition 
of functions; namely, for any functions /, g> h defined on S, we have

(/ +  g) +  h = f  +  (g +  h).

Similarly, for commutativity, we have

f  +  g = g +  f.

Example. Let f(x) = jc2 and g(jc) = sin x. Then

(f +  g) (x) = x2 +  sin x.
Also,

(f +  g) (?r) = 7r2 +  sin 7r = 7r2,

because sin w = 0.
We have the zero function, whose value at every element x of S is 0. 

We denote this function also by 0. Thus for any function f  defined on S, 
we have

/  +  0 = 0 +  /  = /.

If f  is a function defined on S, then we can define minus /, written — fy 
to be the function whose value at an element x of S is

- f ix ) .

Example. If/0c) = x2, then ( — f)(x) = — x2, and ( —/)(5) = —25. We see 
that

f  +  ( —/) = 0 (the zero function).

Thus we see that functions satisfy the same basic rules for addition as numbers.

The same is true for multiplication. If /, g are functions defined on the 
same set S, we define their product fg to be the function whose value at an 
element x of S is the product

f(x)g(x).



316 FUNCTIONS [13, §1]

(fg)(x) = f(x)g(x).

This product is commutative and associative. Furthermore, if 1 denotes 
the constant function having the value 1 for all x in S, then we have the usual 
rules

If = f  and Of = 0.

Finally, our multiplication is distributive with respect to addition, 
because

((/ +  g)h)(x) = (f +  g)(x) ■ h(x)
= (fix) +  g(x))h(x)
= f(x)h(x) +  g(x)h(x)

= (fh)(x) +  (gh)(x)
= (fh +  fg) (x).

Thus
(f +  g)h = fh +  gh.

In physical life, functions of numbers occur when we describe one quantity 
in terms of another.

Example. To each year we associate the population of the United States. 
Then the function is defined only for those years which are ^ 1776. If P 
denotes this function (P for population), then

P(1800) = 7.2 • 106,
P(1900) = 76.0 • 106,
P(1940) = 140 • 106,
P(1970) = 200 • 10°.

Example. To each year we associate the price (in cents) of subway fare in 
New York City. Let S denote this function (S for subway). Then

S (1950) = 15,
S (1969) = 20,
S (1970) = 30.

Thus we have by definition

We suggest that you look at the section on arbitrary mappings for a 
more general notion.

§2. POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS

A function f  defined for all numbers is called a polynomial if there exists 
numbers ao, ai, . . . , an such that for all numbers x we have
(1) f(x) = anxn +  an-ix n~l +  • • • +  aix +  a0.

Example. The function f  such that

f(x) = 3xs -  2x +  1 

is a polynomial function. We have /  (I) = 3 — 2 +  1 = 2.

Example. The function

When a polynomial can be written as in (1) above, we shall say that it is 
of degree ^ n. If an 5* 0, then we want to say that the polynomial has

g : x 1—> %x4 +  3x2 — x +  5
is a polynomial. We have

g{2) = £24 +  3 • 22 -  2 +  5 = 23.



[13, §2] POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS 319

degree n. However, we must be careful. Is it possible that there are other 
numbers &o, . . . , bm such that for all x we have

f(x) = b mXm +  • • • +  &0?

For instance, can we have

7*5 -  5x4 +  2x +  1 = x6 -  17*3 +  x +  1

for all numbers x? The answer is not immediately clear just by looking. 
Suppose that the coefficients were big complicated numbers. We would have 
no simple test for the equality of values. If the answer were YES, then it 
would be hopeless to define the degree, because in the example just written 
down, for instance, we would not know whether the degree is 5 or 6. That the 
answer is NO will be proved in the corollary to Theorem 2 below.

Let f  be a polynomial. If c is a number such that f(c) = 0, then we call 
c a root of /. We shall see in a moment that a non-zero polynomial can have 
only a finite number of roots, and we shall give a bound for the number of 
these roots.

Example. Let f(x) = x2 — 3x +  2. Then /(l) = 0. Hence 1 is a root o f /. 
Also, f(2) = 0. Hence 2 is also a root of /.

Example. Let f(x) = ax2 +  bx +  c. If b2 — 4ac = 0, then the polynomial 
has one real root, which is

_ b _
2 a

If b2 — 4ac > 0, then the polynomial has two distinct real roots which are

— 6 +  V&2 — 4ac , —b — \ /b2 — 4 ac
----------- o------------  2111(1 ----------- o--------------2 a 2 a

These assertions are merely reformulations of the theory of quadratic 
equations in Chapter 4.

Theorem 1. Let f  be a polynomial of degree ^ n and let c be a root. Then 
there exists a polynomial g of degree ^ n — 1 such that for all numbers x 
we have

f{x) = { x -  c)g(x).

Proof. Write

Substitute the value
f(x) = a0 +  a\x +  a2x2 +  • • • +  anxn.

x = {x — c) +  c



320 FUNCTIONS [13, §2]

for x. Each A-th power, for k = 0, . . . , n, of the form

((x -  c) +  c)*
can be expanded out as a sum of powers of (x — c) times a number. Hence 
there exist numbers &o, bi, • • • , bn such that

fix) = bo +  6i(x -  c) +  62(x -  c)2 +  • • • +  M x -  c)\
for all x. But /(c) = 0. Hence

0 = /(c) = bo,

and all the other terms on the right have the value 0 for x = c. This proves 
that 60 = 0. But then we can factor

fix) = (x -  c) (61 +  62(x -  c) +  • • • +  bn(x -  c)n_1)-
We let

g{x) = 61 +  62(x -  c) +  • • • +  b„{x -  c )" -1, 
and we see that our theorem is proved.

Remark. Let us look more carefully at the polynomial g which we obtained 
in the proof. When we expand out a power

((x -  c) +  c)k,

we get a term (x — c)k, and all other terms in the sum involve a lower power 
of (x — c). Hence the highest power of (x — c) which we get is the n-th 
power, and this power comes from the expansion of

((x -  c) +  c)n.
Thus the term with the highest power of (x — c) can be determined explicitly, 
and it is precisely

an(x -  c)\
In other words, we have

bn = On*
Hence the polynomial g which we obtain has an expansion of the form 

g(x) = anxn~l +  lower terms.
This remark will be useful later.

Theorem 2. Let f  be a polynomial. Let ao9 . . .  9 an be numbers such that 
an 7* 0, and such that we have

fix) = anxn +  a„_ixn_1 +  ••• +  <*)

for all x. Then f  has at most n roots.



[13, §2] POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS 321

Proof. Let ci, c2, . . . , cr be distinct roots of f. Suppose that r ^ n. 
Write

fix) =  (x -  Ci)gi(x) 

for some polynomial gi of degree ^ n — 1. Then

o = f(c2) = (c2 -  Ci)^!(c2).

Since c2 ^ ci, it follows that gi(c2) = 0; in other words, c2 is a root of gu 
which has degree ^ n —  1. We can now give the same argument, factoring

gl(x) = (x -  c2)g2(x).
We see that

g2(Cs) = 0,
and that g2 has degree ^ n — 2. We keep on going, until we find gn to be 
constant. Thus we can write

f(x) = (x -  ci)(x -  c2) • • • (x -  cn)c

for all x. In fact, the remark following Theorem 1 shows that

c = an t* 0.

Thus if x 5* C{ for any i = 1, . . . , n, we see that f(x) ^ 0. This means that 
f has at most n roots, and our theorem is proved.

Corollary. Let f be a polynomial, which can be written in the form 

fix) = anxn +  an-ix n~l +  • • • +  a0 

and also in the form

fix) = bnxn +  6n_ixn_1 +  • • • +  60-

Then
a{ = b{ for every i = 0, . . . , n.

Proof. Consider the polynomial

0 =  f{x)  -  f{x)  =  {an -  bn)xn +  (an~i -  6n- i ) x n_1 +  (a0 -  &o).
We have to show that

ai — b{ = 0 for all i = 1, . . . , n.

Let di = at — 6t. Suppose that there exists some index i such that di 0. 
Let m be the largest of these indices, so that we can write

0 = dmxm +  • • • +  do

for all x and dm ^  0. This contradicts Theorem 2. Therefore we conclude 
that d{ = 0 for all i = 1, . . . , n, thus proving our corollary.



322 FUNCTIONS [13, §2]

The corollary shows that if /  is a polynomial, then there is a unique way 
of writing /  in the form

f(x) = anxn +  • • • +  ao

for all x. In other words, the numbers any . . .  y ao are uniquely determined. 
They will be called the coefficients of/, and we call an the leading coefficient 
if an 7* 0. We call ao the constant term.

Example. Let /  be the polynomial such that for all x we have

f{x) = 4x5 -  7x3 +  x -  20.

Then the coefficients of /  are 4, 0, 7, 0, 1, —20. (We have included the co­
efficients of all powers of x up to the fifth. Note that the fourth and second 
power have coefficients equal to 0.) The leading coefficient is 4. The constant 
term is —20.

If a polynomial /  is such that

fix) = an xn +  • • • +  a0,

and a„ ^ 0, then we say that /  has degree n. The polynomial in the preceding 
example has degree 5.

Remark. It often happens that if /  is a polynomial, then

fix) = 0

for some x. In other words, there may exist a number c such that

/(c) = 0.

This does not mean that /  is the zero polynomial. By definition, we call /  the 
zero polynomial if and only if

fix) = 0  for all numbers x.

Thus the zero polynomial is the polynomial all of whose coefficients are 0. 
If some coefficient of a polynomial is not equal to 0, then /  is not the zero 
polynomial. If /  is the zero polynomial, we also sometimes say that /  is 
identically zero (to distinguish this case from the one in which /  may take 
on the value 0 at some number).

In Chapter 4 we found a way of determining all roots of a polynomial 
of degree 2. For polynomials of higher degree, it is much more difficult to 
determine the roots, except in very special cases. For polynomials of degree
3 and 4, one can give formulas involving radicals, but it is a classical result 
that such formulas cannot be given in general for polynomials of degree at 
least 5.



[13, §2] POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS 323

For polynomials whose coefficients are integers, one may ask for the 
rational roots, and much time is often spent in elementary classes finding 
such roots by factoring the polynomial. It is very unusual that a polynomial 
can be factored with integral or rational roots, and I think much too much 
emphasis is placed on this kind of accident. One result of this kind of emphasis 
(which I have found among students) is that they try to factor even 
in the quadratic case, when the systematic answer is available from the 
formula. My experience indicates that such training in factoring is not worth 
the time spent, and therefore we do not emphasize it here. However, we give 
two important examples of factoring.

Example. Let f(x) = Sx2 — 5x +  1. Then the roots of f  are given by the 
quadratic formula of Chapter 4, namely

5 +  V25 -  12 5 +  V l3
C{ =  --------------------------  =  ----------------

6 6
5 -  V25 -  12 5 -  V l3

°2 = 6 = 6

If we look back either at Theorem 1 or at the beginning of the proof of 
Theorem 2, we see that

We have therefore factored f  into factors of degree 1.
Example. The general quadratic case follows the same pattern. Let

/(x) = ax2 +  bx +  c,

and a 0. Assume that b2 — 4ac > 0. Then there are two distinct roots 
Ci and C2 of /, and therefore we have the factorization

fix) = a(x -  ci)(x -  c2).

Example. The other important case of factoring occurs for the polynomial
fix) = *" -  1.

We see that 1 is a root, because /(l)  = l n — 1 = 1 — 1 = 0 . Hence we 
know that /  must have (x — 1) as a factor, i.e. we have

f(x) =  (x -  l)g(x)

for some polynomial g(x). What is g(x)? We suggest that you look at Exercise 
2 of Chapter 1, §6, and do Exercise 6 of this chapter.

We shall now discuss what is sometimes called “ long division” . For 
polynomials it is the analog of the division of two positive integers, with a 
remainder. Therefore we recall this division process for positive integers. 

First, we carry out an example.



324 FUNCTIONS [13, §2]

Example. We want to divide 327 by 17, with a possible remainder. As you 
know from elementary school, this division can be represented schematically 
as follows.

19
17)327 

17 
157 
153 
_ 4

This procedure tells us that

327 = 19-17 +  4.

We call 4 the remainder. We can describe the preceding steps as follows. 
We determined the first digit 1 of 19 as being the largest positive integer 
whose product with 17 would still be ^ 32. We then multiply 1 by 17, write 
it under 32, subtract, get 15, and bring down the 7. We then repeat the 
process. We determine 9 as the largest positive integer whose product with 
17 is ^ 157. We multiply 17 by 9, get 153, write it under 157, subtract, and 
get 4. This number 4 is now less than 17, so we stop.

We can summarize what we have done in general by the following 
statement.

Let n, d be positive integers. Then there exists an integer r such that 
0 ^ r < dy and an integer q ^ 0 such that

n = qd +  r.

Note that even though the standard procedure of the example, which gives 
us q, r, is called “ long division” , in fact our procedure uses only multiplication 
and subtraction.

We shall now describe an analogous procedure for polynomials, which 
gives us the

Euclidean algorithm. Let f  and g be non-zero polynomials. Then there 
exist polynomials q, r such that deg r < deg g and such that

f{x) = q(x)g(x) +  r(x).

Example. Let

f(x) = 4x3 — 3x2 +  x +  2 and g(x) = x2 +  1.

We want to find q(x) and r(x). We first lay out what we do in a diagram



[13, §2] POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS 325

similar to that of long division for integers, and then explain how each step 
is obtained.

4x -  3______________
x2 +  1 )Ax3 -  3x2 +  x +  2 

Ax2 + _______4x
— 3x2 -  3x +  2
— 3x2 -  3

— 3* +  5
We have

q(x) = 4x — 3 and r(x) = — 3x +  5,

so that

(1) 4x3 — 3x2 +  x +  2 = (4x -  3)(x2 +  1) +  (3x +  5).
Now we describe each step in the computation. We first determine 4x 

because
4x • x2

is equal to the term of highest degree in /  (jc) ; that is, equal to 4jc3. We then 
multiply 4x by x2 +  1, we obtain 4x3 +  4x, which we write under /(jc), 
placing corresponding powers of x under each other. We then subtract 
4x3 +  4x from 4x3 — 3x2 +  x +  2, and obtain —3x2 — 3x +  2. We then 
repeat our procedure, and determine —3 because

( —3) • x2

is equal to the term of highest degree in — 3jc2 — 3x +  2. We multiply —3 
by x2 +  1, obtain — 3jc2 — 3, which we write under — 3jc2 — 3x +  2. We 
subtract, and obtain — 3x +  5. We note that the polynomial — 3x +  5 
has degree 1, which is smaller than the degree of g(x) = x2 +  2. Our compu­
tation is therefore finished.

Why does the above procedure actually provide us with polynomials 
q(x) and r(x) satisfying relation (1)? This is easily seen. Write /  (jc) = fo(x) 
to indicate the fact that /  has degree 3. We determined 4jc in such a way that

fz{x) -  4x(x2 +  1) = f3(x) -  4x3 -  4x

has degree 2; i.e. in such a way that the term 4x3 would cancel. Write

/ 2W = f 3 (x) -  4x3 — 4x = —3x2 -  3x +  2.

Then f 2 has degree 2. We determine —3 so that

f 2(x) -  ( —3)(x2 +  1)



326 FUNCTIONS [13, §2]

has degree 1; i.e. in such a way that the term — 3x2 cancels. Then 

f2(x) -  ( -3 ) (* 2 +  1) = A(x) 

has degree 1. Now we see that

f3(x) -  4x-g(x) -  ( —3) • g(x) = -3 x  +  5 

has degree 1. Thus

f3(x) -  (4x -  3)g(x) = — 3x +  5.

This shows why
fs M  = q(x)g(x) +  r(x).

Example. Let

f(x) = 2x4 — 3x2 +  1 and g(x) = x2 — x +  3.

We wish to find q(x) and r(x) as in the Euclidean algorithm. We write down 
our computation in the standard pattern.

2x2 +  2x -  7 
x2 -  x +  3 l2x* -  3x2 +  1 

2x4 -  2x3 +  6x2____________
+ 2 x 3 -  9x2 + 1

2x3 -  2x2 +  6x
- l x 2 -  6x +  1
— 7x2 +  7x -  21

-1 3 x  +  22
Hence we get

q(x) = 2x2 +  2x -  7 and r(x) = -13x +  22.

As a matter of terminology, we call r(x) the remainder in the Euclidean 
algorithm.

Remark. The Euclidean algorithm allows us once more to prove that if fix) 
has a root c, then we can write

f(x) = (x -  c)q(x)

for some polynomial q. Indeed, in the Euclidean algorithm, we have

fix) = q(x)(x -  c) +  r(x),



[13, §2] POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS 327

where deg r < 1. Hence r must be constant, say equal to a number a. Thus

f(x) = q(x)(x -  c) +  a.
Now evaluate the left-hand side and the right-hand side at x = c. We get

0 = 0 +  a,

whence a = 0. The remainder is equal to 0, and this gives what we wanted.

We do not prove the Euclidean algorithm. The proof would consist of 
carrying out the procedure of the example with general coefficients.

9. Rational functions. A rational function is a function which can be 
expressed as a quotient of polynomials, i.e. a function whose value at a 
number x is

fix) 
g(x) ’

where /, g are polynomials, and g is not the zero polynomial. Thus a 
rational function is defined only for those numbers x such that g(x) ^  0. 
In an expression as above, we call f  the numerator of the rational function, 
and g its denominator. We can then work with rational functions just 
as we did with rational numbers. In particular, we can put two rational 
functions over a common (polynomial) denominator, and take their sum 
in a manner analogous to taking the sum of rational numbers. We give 
an example of this.

Example. Put the two rational functions

3x2 — 2x +  6 j  0/ x 4x +  3 
B W ----------------------- art SO) -

over a common denominator.



[13, §2] POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS 329

This denominator will be (x — l)(x — 5), and the two rational 
functions over this common denominator are

(3*2 - 2 *  +  6 ) ( * - 5 )  (4* +  3 ) ( * - l )
R(X) ~ (* -  1)(* -  5) and S(X) ~ (x -  l)(x -  5) •

Their sum is then

t} (3*2 -  2* +  6)(x -  5) +  (4* +  3)(x -  1)
R(X) +  S(X) = (x -  1)(* ^ 5 )  ’

which we see is again a rational function, defined for all numbers ^  1 
or 5. We can expand the expressions in the numerator and denominator 
into the standard form for polynomials, and we see that

n/ \ i o/ n 3x3 — 13x2 +  15x — 33 
R(x) +  S(x) -  _  6x +  5 ’

Now you do the work, and express the sums of the following rational

§3. GRAPHS OF FUNCTIONS

Let f  be a function, defined on a set of numbers S. By the graph of the 
function /, we shall mean the set of all points

(x,f(x)),

i.e. the set of all points whose first coordinate is x, and whose second co­
ordinate is /(x).

Example. Let / (x ) = x2. Then the graph of f  is the graph of the equation 
y  = x2, and is a parabola, as discussed in Chapter 7.

Example. An object moves along the positive x-axis, subjected to a force 
inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the origin. We can 
then write this force as

where k is some constant. Suppose that k = 3, so that y  = 3/x2. It is easy 
to draw the graph of this equation, which is nothing but the graph of the 
function f  such that /(x) = 3/x2; see Fig. 13-1. We make a table of values, 
and observe that as x increases, /(x) decreases.

y = force



[13, §3] GRAPHS OF FUNCTIONS 331

Example. We know that the sine is a function, associating with each number
6 the value sin 0. In fact, in the chapter on trigonometry, we had already 
drawn its graph which looked like this (Fig. 13-2.)

sin 6

Example. We want to sketch the graph of the function

y  = (* -  1)(* “  2).

Observe that when x = 1 or when x = 2, then y  = 0. Furthermore, there 
are no other values of x for which y  = 0. Thus the graph crosses the x-axis 
precisely at the points x = 1 and x = 2. When x < 1, then x — 1 < 0 and 
x — 2 <  0. Hence when x < 1, we see that y  >  0. Similarly, when x >  2, 
we see that y  >  0. Finally, when

1 < x < 2,

then x — 1 > 0 and x — 2 < 0. Hence when 1 < x < 2, we see that y  is 
negative. Finally, when x = 0, we see that

y  = ( —1)(—2) = 2.

The graph of our function looks like this (Fig. 13-3):

This graph is of course the graph of a parabola, since it is the graph of

y  = x2 -  Sx +  2.

We can complete the square, and use the same method as in Chapter 12 to 
sketch the graph. However, the method used here gives us a quicker insight 
into the rough way the graph looks.

Example. Let [x] be the largest integer ^ x. Let fix) = [x]. Then /(2) = 2 
and /(f) = 1. The graph of /  is shown in Fig. 13-4. It looks like a staircase.

§4. EXPONENTIAL FUNCTION

We have already discussed powers like
amin,

where a is a positive number, and m, n are integers, i.e. fractional powers.
It is difficult to give an analytic development of the theory of powers

ax

when x is not a fraction, but at least we can state the basic properties, which 
are intuitively clear, and then use them in applications.

Let a be a number > 0. To each number x we can associate a number 
denoted by ax, such that when x = m/n is a quotient of integers (n 0) then 
am,n is the ordinary fractional power discussed in Chapter 3, §3, and such 
that the function

x • ► dx

has the following properties.



334 FUNCTIONS [13, §4]

a x +  V = axay.

EXP 2. For all numbers x, y , we have

(ax)y = axy.

EXP 3. If a, b are positive,

(a6)x = axbx.

EXP 4. Assume that a > 1. If x <  y, then ax <  ay.

The function
x »—> ax

is called the exponential function to the base a. The proof given in 
Chapter 3, §3 that ao = 1 is valid here. From this and EXP 1 we conclude 
that

EXP 1. For any numbers x, y, we have

This is because

a~xax = ax~x = a0 = 1.

Remark. The values of the exponential function are always positive. In 
fact, if x > 0, and a >  1, then ax >  1 because a0 = 1 and the exponential 
function is increasing according to EXP 4. If x < 0, say x = — z where z is 
positive, then

and we see again that ax is positive. However, in this case, we have ax <  1.



[13, §4] EXPONENTIAL FUNCTION 335

Question. If we allow 0 < a < 1 instead of a > 1, how do you have to 
adjust property EXP 4 to make it valid?

It is now easy to sketch the graph of an exponential function.

Example. Let f(x) = 2X. We make a small table of values, with rational 
numbers and integers for x.

Note that the graph climbs very steeply to the right of 0, and that it becomes 
very flat very fast to the left of 0.

Example. The population of a city doubles every year, and at time t = 0 
it is equal to 100 persons. We can then express this population in the form

P(t) = 100 -2',

when t is an integer. Namely, when t = 0, we get

P( 0) = 100.



336 FUNCTIONS [13, §4]

Each time that t increases by 1, we see that P(t) is multiplied by 2. Thus the 
population P is a function of time t, and again we draw the graph by making 
a table of values as shown in Fig. 13-6, and noticing that P(t) increases 
when t increases.

Population 
P(t) in 100’s

0 1 2 3 4 5

t P(t)

0 100
1 200
2 400
3 800
4 1600
5 3200

Time ( Fig. 13-6

Example. Let f  be a function such that f(t) = Ca5t, where C is a number. 
Such a function is said to have exponential growth. Note that when t = 0, 
we get

m  = c,
so that C is the value of f  at t = 0. If f  represents a population, given as a 
function of time, then C is the original number of persons at time t = 0.

Example. Certain substances disintegrate at a rate proportional to the 
amount of substance present. If f  denotes this amount, then it is known that 
f  as a function of time t is given by the formula

fit) = Ca*‘,

where C, K  are constants. Again note that C is the amount of substance



[13, §4] EXPONENTIAL FUNCTION 337

present at time t = 0. Since the amount of substance decreases, the constant 
K  is negative. For instance, if

fit) = 3a-2*,

if a = 2, and if /  gives the number of grams of radium at a certain place as a 
function of time, then there are 3 g of radium present at the beginning when 
t = 0. If the time is measured in years, then after 4 years, there are

f  (4) = 3 -a~8 = —256
grams of radium left.

c) How much is left after 1,000 years?
d) How much is left after 2,000 years?

§5. LOGARITHMS

Let a be a number > 1 .  If y  = ax, then we shall say that

x is the log of y  to the base a, and write x = loga y-

Example. Since 8 = 23, we see that 3 is the log of 8 to the base 2. We 
write 3 = log2 8.

Example. Since 27 = 33, we see that 3 is the log of 27 to the base 3. We 
write 3 = log3 27.

The log is a function, defined for all positive numbers. We shall not prove 
this, but assume that it is a basic property of numbers. In other words, we 
assume that:

Given a number y  > 0, there exists a number x such that

ax = y.



[13, §5] LOGARITHMS 339

We can now prove properties of the log which are similar to those of the 
exponential function.

LOG 1. For any numbers x, y, we have

loga(ry) = log ax +  log ay.

LOG 2. We have
log a 1 = 0 .

LOG 3. If x <  y , then loga x <  loga y.

These properties can be proved from the corresponding properties of the 
exponential function. We now do this.

Proof of LOG 1. Let u = loga x and v = loga y. This means that 

x = au and y  = av.

Hence
xy = auav = au+u.

By definition,
loga (xy) = u +  v = lo g  a x +  loga y.

Proof of LOG 2. By definition, since a0 = 1, this means that

0 = log« 1.

Proof of LOG 3. Let x <  y. Let u = loga x and v = logay. Then

au = x and av = y .

If u = v, then x = y, which is impossible. If v <  u, then by EXP 4 we find 
y  <  x, which is also impossible. Hence we must have u <  v, thereby proving 
our property LOG 3.

It is easy to draw a graph for the log. We leave this as an exercise. 
We also let you go through the properties of the log when a <  1, but a > 0. 
Which ones are still valid, and which type should be changed?

We can use the log to solve equations of the exponential type.

Example. Let f(t) =  10 • 2kty where k is constant. Suppose that f{\) = 3. 
Find k.

We have
3 = 10 • 2k'2.



340 FUNCTIONS [13, §5]

Taking the log to the base 2 on both sides, we find that

klog2 3 = log2 10 +  -  •

Hence
k = 2(log2 3 — log2 10).

This argument can be used in a laboratory. For instance, suppose that 
we leave 10 g of a substance to decompose at time t = 0. We know that the 
amount of substance is given by the formula in the example above, with an 
unspecified constant k, and we wish to determine the value of k. If after 
half an hour we have 3 g of the substance left, then we get our value of k as 
in the example. Tables of logarithms or a computing machine then give us a 
decimal value for k.

Example. A radioactive substance disintegrates according to the formula

r(t) = C3-5',

where C is a constant ^ 0. At what time will there be exactly one-third of 
the original amount left?

At time t = 0 we have r(0) = C amount of substance. We must find 
that value of t such that

r(t) = | C,

or in other words,

\ C = C3~5t.o

Note that we can cancel C.
Take the log to the base 3. Then the previous equation is equivalent with

log3 (| )  = - 5 1,

or equivalently,
- 1  = —51.

Thus

Observe how in this example the unspecified constant C does not appear in 
the final answer.

3. Let e be a fixed number > 1 and abbreviate loge by log. If a is > 1 
and x is an arbitrary number, prove that

log ax = x log a.

[Hint: Consider e(loga)x, and use EXP 2.] For instance,

log 102'3 = § log 10.

For the next exercises, assume that the number e has been fixed, and that 
log = loge. Thus your answers will be expressed in terms of log*. There are 
tables for various values of e which can be used if you want decimal answers, 
but we are not concerned with this here. Remember that loge e = 1. Among 
all numbers e which we may take as the base for logarithms, there is one which 
is the most useful, and you will understand why when you take calculus. For 
our purposes here, we want you mainly to learn to operate with the formalism 
of the logarithm. However, work out the next computations. Suppose that 
e is chosen so that log 2 = 0.6. Find a decimal for:

74 Mappings

§1. DEFINITION

We note that a function is an association. We have already seen other 
types of associations, namely mappings of the plane into itself. It is therefore 
convenient to define a general notion which covers both cases, and any other 
case like them.

We have also seen functions which are not defined for all numbers, and 
for which it was necessary to specify those numbers where it is defined.

Similarly, a function like x »—► x2 does not take on all real numbers as 
values, only numbers ^ 0. Thus it is convenient to specify which values a 
function might take. We therefore make the following definition.

Let Sy S' be sets. A mapping from S into S' is an association

f: S - *  S'

which to each element x in S associates an element f(x) of S'. We call / ( x) 
the value of the mapping f  at x, or the image of x under f.

Functions are special cases of mappings, and so are mappings of the plane 
into itself. In the latter case, S = R2 = S'. We have other examples. Dis­
regard those for which you have not read the corresponding section in the 
book.

Example. Let P = (1, 2) and A = ( —3, 5). The association
t •—► P -}- tA = (1 — St, 2 -}- 51)

is a mapping from the real numbers into the plane. It is our old parametriza- 
tion of a line.

Example. The association
6 »—► (cos Q, sin 6), 6 in R,

is a mapping from the real numbers into the plane. In fact, it is a mapping 
into the circle of radius 1 centered at the origin.

345



346 MAPPINGS [14, §1]

If /: iS —> S' is a mapping, and T is a subset of S, then the set of all values 
f(t) with t in T  is called the image of T under /, and is denoted by f(T).

Example. The image of the mapping

6 i—► (cos 6, sin 6)

is the circle of radius 1 centered at the origin.

Example. The image of the mapping

x i—► (x, x2), x in R,

is the graph of the function x ^  x2, and is a parabola.

Example. Let a, b be positive numbers. Let

Fatb: R2 -> R2

be the mapping such that
Fa>b(x,y) = {ax, by).

The image of the circle of radius 1 centered at the origin is an ellipse. 

Example. Consider the mapping

/: R R2

given by
f(t) = it2, f3).

We view this as a curve, whose coordinates are given as a function of t. 
Thus we also write

x (t) = t2 and y(t) = t3

to denote the dependence of the coordinates on t. We view such a mapping 
as a parametrization of a curve. We can draw the image of this mapping in 
the plane. We make a small table of values as usual.

t x(t) y(f) t x(t) y(t)

1 1 l - l 1 - l
2 4 8 - 2 4 - 8
3 9 27 - 3 9 -27

For any t, the value x(t) is ^ 0, and increases with t. When t is positive, y(t) 
is positive. When t is negative, y(t) is negative. Thus we see in Fig. 14-1 
what the image of the mapping looks like.



[14, §1] DEFINITION 347

y

Example. Suppose that a stone is thrown from a tall building, in the 
horizontal direction. Then gravity pulls the stone down. We want to give 
the coordinates (x{t),y(t)) of the stone as a function of time t. Let the 
building be 50 ft tall. Then x{t) = ct,
where c is some positive constant depending on the strength of the throw. 
The action of gravity determines the second coordinate to be

y{t) = 50 -  Ig t2 

where g is constant. Thus we have a mapping

t ■-» (ct, 50 —  ̂gt^j »

defined for t ^ 0 and for t ^ to, where to is the time at which the stone strikes 
the ground. See the picture in Fig. 14-2.



348 MAPPINGS [14, §1]

Our mapping associates with each time t in the given range the position of 
the stone at time t. If we want to find the time at which the stone hits the 
ground, we have to find the time t such that

50 0,

or in other words,

We obtain

\gt2 = 50.

t =

If the distance is measured in feet, and the time in seconds, then the value 
of g is 32. Hence in this case our value for t is

^5
32 = y j - 8 8ec-

Example. Let S = R2. Then the association

X ^ d ( X ,  O)

which to each point X  associates its distance from the origin is a mapping, 
whose values are real numbers ^ 0.

In general, we shall follow the convention that a mapping from a set S 
into the real numbers is called a function. Thus

X  d(X, O)

is called the distance function. Of course, given a point P, we obtain 
another function

X ^ d ( X ,  P), 

whose value at X  is the distance between X  and P.

Example. The mapping

(x,y) »-> x2 +  cos (xy) 

is a function, defined on R2.

Example. At a given time t, we let f(t) be the temperature of a certain 
body. Then f  is a function of time.

Fool around with other special cases so that you get the hang of this 
system. The map F  in this exercise is called the polar coordinate map.

§2. FORMALISM OF MAPPINGS

Mappings in general satisfy a formalism similar to that developed for 
mappings of the plane into itself. We shall now repeat this formalism briefly. 

We have the identity mapping I s for any set S, such that

Is(x) = x for all x in S.

Sometimes we omit the subscript S on I  if the reference to S is made clear 
by the context.

Let
/: S -> T and g: U -> V

be mappings. Assume that T is a subset of U . Then we can form the 
composite mapping g o /, whose value at an element x of S is

(g°f)(x) = gif(x)).

Note that f{x) is an element of T, and since T is a subset of U, we can take 
g{f(x))> whose value is now in V .

Example. Let f  and g be given by

f(x) = x2 and g(u) = sin u.

Then
g(f(x)) = g(x2) =  sin(x2).

Example. Let f  and g be given by

f(x) = 3jc — 2 and g(u) = —-—cos u



352 MAPPINGS [14, §2]

Then
1

cos(3jc — 2)

7rObserve that g is defined only for those numbers u such that u j* -  +  mr,2
and n is an integer. Thus the composite function is defined only for those 
numbers x such that

3x -  2 J* ^  +  717T,

and n is an integer.

Example. Let I: S —> S be the identity mapping, and let

f : S  ->S

be any mapping. Then
J o /  =  f o l  = f .

This is clear, because, for any x in S, we have

(I °f) (x) = I(fix)) = f(x),

and similarly,
( / ° I) (x) = f(I(x)) = f(x).

We note that the identity mapping behaves like the number 1 in a context 
where composition of mappings behaves like multiplication. This analogy 
is again evident in our next assertion.

Composition of mappings is associative. This means: If

/: S -> T, g : T - + U ,  h: U -> V

are mappings, then
(hog) of = ho(gof).

The proof is exactly the same as the proof for the associativity of isometries 
of the plane into itself. Namely for any x in S, we have

((hog)of)(x) =  (hog)(f(x)) = h(g(f(x)))

(ho(gof))(x) = h((gof)(x)) = h(g(f(x))).

Let
/: S —> T



[14, §2] FORMALISM OF MAPPINGS 353

be a mapping. By an inverse mapping for /, we mean a mapping

g: T S

such that the composites of f  and g are the identities of S and T, respectively; 
that is,

g ° f  = Is and fog = I T.

We have had many examples of inverse mappings with translations, rotations, 
and the like. We also have examples with functions.

Example. Let R+ denote the positive real numbers. Let

f: R+ -> R+

be the square, i.e. fix) = x2. Then f  has an inverse function, namely the 
square root. Ifx > 0 and* is the square root, then* (x2) = xand/(\/x) = x. 
Thus /, g are inverse to each other.

Example. The exponential function and the logarithm are inverse to each 
other (when taken to the same base). In other words,

alogaX = x and loga(ax) = x.

This is merely the definition of the logarithm.
Thus we see that the notion of inverse mapping or inverse function 

includes many special cases already considered.
If /: S —» T is a mapping having an inverse mapping, then we denote 

this inverse by
f~ l: T —> S.

The elementary proof concerning the inverse of a number can be applied to 
give the uniqueness of the inverse mapping. Indeed, suppose that

*: T -> S and h: T -» S

are inverse mappings for /. Then we must have g = h. We leave the proof 
as an exercise.

The section on permutations will provide further examples for mappings, 
as well as an extension of the theory in an interesting direction. You may 
well want to read our next remarks in connection with permutations, and 
their iterations.

Let /: S —» S be a mapping of a set into itself. We may then iterate /. 
If x is an element of S, then we can form the iterates of the values,

fix), fifix)), f  {f (fix))).........

We use the exponential notation, and write

f i x )  = /(/(*))
fHx) = m m ) )

In general, we write

/*(*) = / ( / ( / ( . . . a * ) . . . ) ) )
for the iteration of f  taken k times, applied to x. Thus fk is again a function 
defined on S, with values in S. The value of f k at x is f k(x). Observe that 
fk + i __ f 0f k̂ or> jn terms of x,

Example. Let /: R —► R be the function such that fix) = x +  1. Then 

f 2(x) = f(f(x)) = f ( x  +  1) = x +  2.

Similarly,
f 3(x) = fif2(x)) -  f i x +  2) = x +  3.

In general, we see that
f k(x) = x +  k

for any positive integer k.

Example. Let F : R2 —► R2 be the mapping given by

F(x,y) = (x +  3,y -  4).

If we denote {x, y) by X  and if we let A = (3, —4), then we can abbreviate 
the formula describing F  as follows:

F(X) = X  +  A.

Thus we see that F  is translation by A. Iterating F  is analogous to the process 
used in the preceding example. For instance,

F 2(X) = F (X  +  A) = X +  A +  A =  X  +  2A,

and in general, for any positive integer k, we have

F \ X )  = X  +  kA.

Example. Let f: R —> R be the map given by f(x) = Xs. Then

f\x )  =  /(/(*)) = f(x3) =  ix3)3 = x \



[14, §2] FORMALISM OF MAPPINGS 355

Also,
f\x) = f(f2(xj) = fix9) = (x9)3 = x27.

In general, for any positive integer k, we have

f ix )  = x3*.

Just as with mappings of the plane into itself, we have a general rule of 
exponent for mappings; namely, if m, n are positive integers and

/: S —> S
is a mapping, then

f m  +n  =  ym  q

This simply means that if we iterate the mapping m +  n times, it amounts 
to iterating it first n times and then m times. Thus our formula is clear. 
We define

f °  = I  ( = Is, identity mapping)

and we see that our formula also holds if m or n is 0. This is an immediate 
consequence of the definitions.

In fact, this formula also holds for negative integers m or n, if we make 
the appropriate definition. Namely, assume that f~ l exists. Then we define

r h = (r 1)*

to be the composite of f~ l with itself k times. Note that

fko f -k = f °  = I.

This just means that if we apply f~1 to an element k times, and then apply f 
itself k times, we get that element. We can draw the picture as follows. 
Let x be an element of S. Then

f k° r k(x) = f i f ( . . . f ( r i i r i{. . . r iix)))))). 

k times k times

But the f  of~l in the middle is the identity I. Similarly, we combine f  ° f ~ l 
to get J, and we do this k times to see that

i k o f - \ X ) = X.

Note. Later we shall discuss a more formal way of giving the above 
proof, namely induction. After you have read about induction, you will then 
understand the following argument which proves that

f k° f - k = I

by induction. It is true for k = 1 by definition. Assume it for a positive 
integer k. Then

ffc+l0f -(k+V = fo fko ( f -1)kof~1

= f o l o f - 1 (by induction)

=  f ° r 1 =  / .

Example. Let /: R —> R be the map such that f(x) = x +  3. Then 

fk{x) = x +  3k and f~k(x) = x — 3k.

Example. Let A = (3, —4) and let F: R 2 —> R 2 be the map such that

F(X) = X  +  A.
Then

Fk(X) = X  +  kA and F~k(X) = X  -  kA.

Example. Let /: R —> R be the map such that f(x) = x3. Then

/*(*) = and / “ *(*) =

In general, for any integers m, n (positive, negative, or zero) and any map 
f: S —> S which has an inverse, we have the formula

This can also be proved by induction, but we omit the proof.

Example. Inserting special numbers into the above formula, we have

f 5° r 3 = / 2.

Example. Suppose that f m = f n for some integers m, n, and assume that 
f  has an inverse mapping. Then, composing both sides with / -n, we obtain

r ~ n = /.

Observe again how composition of mappings is analogous to multiplication.



[14, §2] FORMALISM OF MAPPINGS 357

Example. If f  has an inverse mapping, and if / 4 = f  then

f  = I.

Example. Let A, . . . , fm be mappings of a set S such that

f i = I

f\ ° / 2 ° * • ° fm ° f  = I.

Compose on the left with f\y which is nothing but f^ 1- We obtain

/ 2°* • * °fm °f = /l.

Proceeding in this way, composing with fa, . . . , fm successively, we find that

f  = fm ° fm — 1 °* * *°/2°/l.
This procedure will be used in the next section when we deal with permu­
tations.

§3. PERMUTATIONS

Let c1n be the set of integers 1, 2, . . . , n, that is the set of integers k such 
that 1 ^ k ^ n. By a permutation of J„, we mean a mapping

(T.Jn * cT"n
having the following property. If i, 7 are in J n and i ^  j f then <r(i) 5* (T(j). 
Thus the image of a permutation a consists of n distinct integers

o-(l), <7(2), . . . , a(n),

which must therefore be the integers 1, 2, . . . , n in a different order. Thus 
we denote such a permutation a by the symbols

Example. The permutation of J4 given by

is such that

cr(l) =  3, <r(2) =  1, (7(3) =  4, (7(4) =  2.

360 MAPPINGS [14, §3]

If a and a' are permutations, we denote their composite by <7<7', omitting 
the little circle between them for simplicity and to emphasize the analogy 
with “ multiplication” . In fact, we also call this composite the product of 
a and a'. Watch out! It is not always true that <j<j' = a'a.

Example. Let

To determine cr'a, we just look at the effect of this composite on each one of 
the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4. Thus with arrows:

1 2  3 4
2 3 4 1 and cr' =

Thus we have

On the other hand, in a similar way, you find that

1 2  3 4 
4 1 3  2

Thus era' ^ cr'cr.

Example. Let

a

and a' =

Then
crcr'(l) = <r(<r'(l)) = <r(3) = 3, 
<r<r'(2) = <t(<t'(2)) = <r(l) = 2, 
<t<t'(3) = <r(o-'(3)) = <r{ 2) = 1,

so that we can write
1 2 3



[14, §3] PERMUTATIONS 361

If O' is a permutation of J n, then we have already mentioned that

<7(1), <7(2), . . . , a  (it)

are simply the elements of J n in a different order. Thus to each element j  oiJn 
there exists a unique element i such that

a(i) = j.

We can therefore define the inverse permutation of <7, as with inverse 
mappings, to be that permutation <7-1 such that

<7<7—1 = <7_1<7 = I  (the identity permutation).

We have a(i) = j  if and only if a- -1 (j) = i.

Example. Let
"1 2 3"<7 =
|_3 1 2_

Since <7(1) = 3 we have <7- 1(3) = 1. Since <7(2) = 1 we have <7_1(1) = 2. 
Since <7(3) = 2 we have<7_1(2) = 3. Hence

Example. The identity permutation is of course given by

If <7i, . . . , <7r are permutations of Jn, then the inverse of the composite 
permutation

<7i • • • <7r

is the permutation
<7r • • • <71 .

Just multiply one with the other, and you will find that all the factors cancel 
out to give the identity.

For instance, with three permutations, we have

(<r i<t2o’3)~ 1 =  o’i 'V i 'V r 1
because

and similarly on the other side.

<7i<72<73<73 X<72 V i  1 = / ,



362 MAPPINGS [14, §3]

There is an important special case of a permutation, namely the trans­
position which interchanges two distinct numbers i ^ j, and leaves the 
others fixed.

Example. The permutation

_ T1 2 3 41
“  |_1 3 2 4j

is a transposition, which interchanges 3 and 2, and leaves 1, 4 fixed. 

If t  is a transposition, then it is clear that
t 2 =  I .

Thus in this case, we have

Theorem 1. Every permutation of J n can be expressed as a product of 
transpositions.

Proof. Let a be a permutation of J n. Let O’(n) = k. If k = n, we let t x 
be the identity. If k ^ n, we let r n be the transposition which interchanges 
k and n, and leaves the other integers fixed. Then Tna leaves n fixed, and may 
therefore be viewed as a permutation of J n-i-  We now repeat our procedure. 
We let Tn_i be either the identity, or a transposition of Jn—\ such that

Tn — lT n&

leaves n and n — 1 fixed. We continue in this way, finding

T n —1> • • • t T 2, Tl 
which are either the identity, or transpositions. Finally

T 1T 2 • • • d e ­
leaves every one of the numbers 1, . . . , n fixed, and is therefore equal to the 
identity. Thus

t it 2 • • • r na = I.
2Now multiply on the left by Ti, then by T2, and so on. Since t* = I  for each 

i9 we find that
(T =  T n  • • • T l.

In this product, we may omit those T ; which are the identity, and we find 
that a has been expressed as a product of transpositions.
Note. It may happen, of course, as when a is the identity already, that 
every Ti is the identity, so that in our product, we have simply a = I. Thus,



[14, §3] PERMUTATIONS 363

in a sense, there is no transposition in this product. It is a matter of convention 
about our use of language how we deal with this case. The best convention is 
to agree that I is the product of zero transpositions, and allow this possibility 
to be included in our expression “ product of transpositions” . After all, we 
did not say how many transpositions, and it could have been zero. With 
this convention, the formulation we have given to Theorem 1 is correct.

The procedure used to prove Theorem 1 gives us an effective way in 
practice to express a permutation as a product of transpositions.

Example. Let

We want to express a as a product of transpositions. Let r be the trans­
position which interchanges 3 and 1, and leaves 2 fixed. Then we find that

so that ra is a transposition, which we denote by t ' .  We can then write 
ra = t ' ,  so that composing on the left with r yields

Now let t 2 be the transposition which interchanges 2 and 3, and leaves 1, 4

and we see that T2T\<T is a transposition, which we may denote by r3. Then 
we get t 2T\d = T3 so that multiplying on the left with T2 and T\ successively

1 2 3
3 1 2

a  =  t t '

because t 2 = 7. This is the desired product.

Example. We want to express the permutation

as a product of transpositions. Let T\ be the transposition which interchanges
1 and 2, and leaves 3, 4 fixed. Then

fixed. Then

we get a = T1T2T3.

This is the desired expression.



364 MAPPINGS [14, §3]

In expressing a permutation as a product of transpositions, there is of 
course no uniqueness. This is possible in many ways.

Example. Take the permutation a of the preceding example. Let T4 be the 
transposition which interchanges 1 and 3. Then

"12 3 4
T 4 (7 =

12 1 4 3_

If again T\ is the transposition which interchanges 1 and 2, and T3 is the 
transposition which interchanges 3 and 4, we see that

r4a = T1T3.

Hence composing on the left with t 4 yields
a = T4T1T3.

Even though we don’t have uniqueness of the expression of a as a product 
of transpositions, still an interesting phenomenon occurs. Suppose that we 
have written a as a product of transpositions in two ways:

<r =  T i • • • Tr =  t 'i  • • • t ' .

The number of transpositions occurring in these expressions may not be the 
same, but it turns out that if r is even, then s must also be even, and if r is 
odd, then s must also be odd. In other words, we have:

Theorem 2. Let a be a permutation of J n. In any expressions of a as a 
product of transpositions, the number of transpositions occurring in such a 
product is either always even or always odd.

The proof for Theorem 2 will involve a little more theory about permuta­
tions than we have right now, and we postpone it to the end. However, to 
use Theorem 2 is very easy, and we make some comments about that.

Suppose that a permutation a can be expressed as a product of an even 
number of transpositions. Then we say that a is an even permutation. 
If it can be expressed as a product of an odd number of transpositions, then 
we say that a is an odd permutation. If

<T =  Ti • • • Tm

is an expression of a as a product of transposition, then we call

( - l ) m

the sign of <7 . This sign is 1 or —1 according as a is even or odd.



[14, §3] PERMUTATIONS 365

Example. The sign of the permutation

-P21.3 1

is 1, and a is an even permutation (cf. a previous example where we expressed 
this permutation as a product of 2 transpositions).

Example. The sign of the permutation

a =
1 2  3 4
2 3 4 1

is — 1, and a is an odd permutation (cf. a previous example where we expressed 
this permutation as a product of 3 transpositions).

If you are not interested in the proof of Theorem 2 , or in the further theory 
of permutations, you may omit the rest of this section.

We now start on the discussion which will lead to the proof of Theorem 2. 
It involves looking more closely into the structure of permutations.

Let a be a permutation of J n and let i be one of the integers in J n. Let us 
look at what happens to i when we apply successive powers of <r. We obtain

i, <r(i), a2(i)...........

Since J n has only a finite number of elements, it follows that these numbers 
cannot be all distinct. Let us see this on an example.

Example. Let

cr =
1 2  3 4
3 5 4

4 5]
1 2J

Let us start with i =  1. Then

<r(l) = 3,
<r2( 1) = <r( 3) = 4,
<r3(l) = <r(4) = 1.

Now we see that we start over again, namely

<r4(l) = <r(<r3(l)) = <r(l) = 3, 
<r5(l) = 4,
<r6(l) = 1.



366 MAPPINGS [14, §3]

We see that we are going around in a circle, and we can even represent the 
numbers 1, 3, 4 on a circle as in Fig. 14-3.

(l) = :* Fig. 14-3

In general, starting with any i, we have an analogous situation. Since the 
set J n has only a finite number of elements, it follows that the numbers

i, <r(i), <r2{i), <r3(i), . . .

are not all distinct. Hence there exist two positive integers r, s with r < s 
such that <rr(i) = <rs(i). Applying a~r to both sides, we get

i = as~r(i).

Thus some power of a leaves i fixed. Let k be the smallest positive integer 
such that ak(i) = i. We contend that the numbers

i, u(i), u2{i)...........  ak~Hi)

are distinct.
Proof. If am(i) = an(i) with two integers m, n such that

1 ^ m < n ^ k,

then an~m(i) = i, and n — m < k. This contradicts our assumption that k 
is the smallest positive integer such that vk{i) = i, and therefore proves our 
contention.

We now see that the general situation is analogous to that of the example, 
and we can represent the numbers

i, <r(i), <r 2(i), <Tk-'(i)

as going around a circle as illustrated in Fig. 14-4. We shall call the set 
consisting of

i, a(i), <r2(i), . . . ,  <Tk~l(i)



[14, §3] PERMUTATIONS 367

<r* ( i) = i

an orbit of <r, or, specifically, the orbit to which i belongs. The effect of a on 
this orbit will be denoted by square brackets,

7 = [i, <T(i), . . . ,<Tk- l {i)),

and will be called the cycle of the orbit. We call k the period of i under a, 
or also the period of the cycle, or the length of the cycle.

Example. Consider again the permutation
"1 2 3 4 51

<j = L3 5 4 1 2j

Then the orbit of 1 consists of 1, 3, 4, and its cycle is denoted by

[1, 3, 4].
The cycle of 2 is given by

[2, 5]
because

<r( 2) = 5 and <r(5) = 2.

According to our terminology, we see that 1 has period 3 under <r, whereas 2 
has period 2. The cycle to which 1 belongs has length 3, and the cycle to 
which 5 belongs has length 2.

Note that in the orbit of 1, we could have selected 3 and started con­
sidering

3, <r(3), <r2 (3), a3 (3) = 3, 

so that the cycle [1, 3, 4] can also be written

Similarly, we have [2, 5] = [5, 2].

[3, 4, 1].



368 MAPPINGS [14, §3]

Example. Let a be the identity permutation of J n. Then each orbit of a 
consists of a single element, because a(i) = i for each i.

Example. Let r be a transposition, which interchanges the two numbers
a, b and leaves the others fixed. Then the orbit of a (or b) consists of a, b and 
its cycle is denoted by [a, b]. All the other orbits consist of one element. 
Thus we may write for simplicity

r = [a, b].

Example. Let
1 2 3 4 51

(T = |_2 3 4 5 l j

Then a has just one orbit, namely J 5 itself, and its cycle is

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

We have the usual picture representing a in Fig. 14-5.

As with transpositions, it will be useful to write

(7 = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2].

Example. Let
_ ri 2 3 4 5"

a ~ L3 5 4 1 2_ *

Then a has two orbits, whose cycles are

[1, 3, 4] and [2, 5].

Observe that the two orbits have no elements in common. This is a special 
case of a general fact, which we shall state and prove below. The effect of



[14, §3] PERMUTATIONS 369

a is determined by its effect on the orbits, and hence we shall use the notation

a = [1, 3, 4][2, 5].

We shall call this the orbit decomposition of a.

Theorem 3 . If a, b are elements of J n and a is a permutation of J n, then 
the orbits to which a and b belong either coincide, or have no element in 
common, i.e. are disjoint.

Proof. Suppose that the orbits have some element in common. This 
means that we have

<Tr(a) = as(b) 

for some positive integers r, s. Then

a = as~T(b)t

and thus we see that a occurs as some am(b). But then all the numbers

a (a) = am+l (6), <r2(a) = <rm+2(b), . . .

occur in the orbit of 6, which means that the orbit of a is contained in the 
orbit of b. Conversely, we see in the same way that the orbit of b is contained 
in the orbit of a, and thus the two orbits must be equal. This proves our 
theorem.

Let S be a given orbit of a and let i be any element of S. Let us denote 
the cycle of the orbit by

7 = [i, a (i) ,. . . ,  a * '1 (*)].

If Si, . . . , Sm are the disjoint orbits of a, then they have corresponding cycles
7i, . . . , 7m and we write symbolically

a = 7i72 • • • 7m.
We call this the orbit decomposition of a, as in our example above. 

Example. Let

a
_ [1 2 3 4 5 61 
“  |_5 6 2 1 4 3j *

Then the two orbit cycles are
[1, 5, 4] and [2, 6, 3]. 

Thus we get the orbit decomposition of a; namely,
(T = [1, 5, 4][2, 6, 3].



370 MAPPINGS [14, §3]

In this case, both cycles have length 3, and every element of has period
3 under a.

Example. We can write the orbit decomposition of the identity of J n as

I  = [1][2] . . . [n].

Let O' be a permutation of J n and let Si, . . . , Sm be its orbits. We then 
have the representation of O' as a product of cycles

o’ = 7i - - - 7m

corresponding to these orbits. We ask: What are the orbits of r<r, if r is a 
transposition? Two cases arise. Let r = [a, 6].

Case 1. The two numbers a, b belong to the same orbit of <r, say Si. Let

?i = [ii, • • • , ik\

be the cycle of this orbit, and suppose that

a = ir and b = is

with r <  s. Thus we can express symbolically the effect of t< t on the orbit 
Si by

T7i = [ir, i,][iu . . . , ir- l ,  ir, . . . , is-1, is, . . . , I*].

Now follow through the effect of rTi on each one of the numbers above. We 
see that under rTi, we have:

il I—> i*2 1—► • • • 1—► ir—1 1—> is 1—> is+1 1—* * * * 1—> ik 1—> i\,

thus forming a cycle

y  \ =  [i*l, i*2> • • • , ir—l, is, is-\-l, • • • , ik\•

On the other hand, we see that under rTi, we have:

ir ► ir+1 »—>•.•»—> is_ 1 Y—» irj

thus forming another cycle

^ 1  =  [ i r ,  i r - \ - \ ,  • • • , i s —  1 ]

which is disjoint from y [ . Furthermore, r has no effect on the cycles
72, . . . , 7m. Hence

TU = T7i72 • • • 7m = 7 [y"y2 • • • 7m.



[14, §3] PERMUTATIONS 371

Thus r splits the orbits Si into two distinct orbits Si and S "  while leaving 
all other orbits fixed. In the present case, we see that ra has one more 
orbit than <r.

Case 2 . The two numbers a, b belong to distinct orbits of <r, say Si and S2.

If you work out the same type of argument as in Case 1, you will see that 
the effect of r on the orbits of a is to join Si and S2, so that ra has one less 
orbit than a. You just have to follow through what happens to each one of 
the integers in the cycles

7 1 = [iu . . . , ir] and 72 = \ju . . . J s]

corresponding to the two orbits Si and S2. You will see that r has the effect 
of joining these orbits into a single orbit for ra. Hence in this case, ra has 
one less orbit than a.

How does all this apply to the proof of Theorem 2? Very simply. Suppose 
that a given permutation a of Jn can be written as a product of an odd 
number of transpositions, say

<X T i * * * Tp,

where p is odd. Let us start with the identity 7, which has n orbits. As we 
multiply 7 successively by rp, rp_i, . . . , T i, we either increase the number 
of orbits by 1, or decrease it by 1, each time. Consequently, we obtain the 
relation:

Number of orbits of a = n +  an odd integer.

If it were possible to express (rasa product

<T =  T i  • • • Tq,

where q is even, then arguing similarly, we would obtain the relation: 

Number of orbits of a = n +  an even integer.

However the integer
(Number of orbits of <r) — n

is either odd or even, and cannot be both. Consequently we cannot express 
a both as a product of an even number of transpositions and an odd number 
of transpositions. This concludes the proof of Theorem 2.

The general rule following from this discussion can be stated as follows.

Theorem 4. Let a be a permutation of Jn and suppose that a has k orbits. 
If n — k is even, the a is an even permutation. If n — k is odd, then a 
is an odd permutation.



372 MAPPINGS [14, §3]

Example. Theorem 4 gives us another method for determining the sign of 
a permutation. For instance, take n = 6. In a previous example we have 
seen that the permutation

1 2 3 4 5 6'
5 6 2 1 4 3

a =

has two orbits, whose cycles are

[1, 5, 4] and [2, 6, 3].

Since 6 — 2 = 4 is even, it follows that a is an even permutation.

Example. Let n = 5. The permutation

2 3 4 5 
5 4 1 2 .

has two orbits, whose cycles are

[1, 3, 4] and [2, 5].
Since 5 — 2 = 3 is odd, it follows that a is an odd permutation.

15 Complex Numbers

§1. THE COMPLEX PLANE

The set of complex numbers is a set whose elements can be added and 
multiplied, so that the sum of complex numbers is a complex number, the 
product of complex numbers is a complex number, and so that addition and 
multiplication satisfy the following properties:

Addition is commutative and associative.
Multiplication is commutative, associative, and distributive with respect to 
addition.
Every real number is a complex number, and if a, b are real numbers, then 
their sum and product as complex numbers are the same as their sum and 
product as real numbers, respectively.
If  1 is the real number one, then 1 z — z for every complex number z. 
Similarly, 0z = 0.
Each complex number z has an additive inverse, namely (— l)z, so that

z +  ( —1 )z = 0.
There exists a complex number i such that i2 = —1.
Every complex number can be written in the form

a +  bi,
where a, b are real numbers.

Thus in the complex numbers we can take a square root of —1. Remember 
the arguments we gave when we discussed square roots in the real numbers. 
These arguments apply here, to show that

i, — i
are the only two complex numbers whose square is —1.

375



376 COMPLEX NUMBERS [15, §1]

Just as we represented real numbers on a line, we can represent complex 
numbers in the plane. Namely, if z = a +  bi is a complex number, we view 
z as the point (a, b) in the plane. Thus i is represented by the point (0, 1) 
as shown in Fig. 15-1.

Fig. 15-1

We could, in fact, define a complex number to be a pair of real numbers 
(a, b)y and define i to be the pair (0, 1). Then we could define addition of 
complex numbers just as we defined addition of points in the plane, com­
ponentwise. Thus if

z = (x* y ) and w = (u, v) 

with x, y, u, v real, then

z +  w = (x +  u, y  +  v).

With this definition, we identify a real number x with the point (x, 0) in the 
plane. If c is a real number, we keep our old definition of multiplication, 
and define

cz = (cx9 cy).

Then we see that every complex number z as above can be written as

x +  iy.

We would still have to define multiplication of complex numbers. If we 
assume that complex numbers exist satisfying our list of properties, then the 
product of two complex numbers

z = x +  iy and w = u +  iv

(x +  iy)(u +  iv) = x (u +  iv) +  iy(u +  iv)
= xu +  ixv +  iyu +  i2yv 
= xu — yv +  (xv +  yu)i.

is g iven  b y



[15, §1] THE COMPLEX PLANE 377

If we want to define the multiplication of points

(x,y)(u, v)
to satisfy the properties listed above, then we must take the definition that 
this product is equal to the point

(xu -  yv, XV + yu).
We could then verify by brute force that all the properties listed above are 
valid, having defined multiplication this way. This would be boring, so we 
omit it, and just assume all the properties.

From now on, we assume that complex numbers exist, and can be 
represented as points in the plane. We identify a real number a with the point 
(a, 0). For this reason, the plane is sometimes called the complex plane.

In multiplying complex numbers, we use the rule i2 = — 1 to simplify 
a product and to put it in the form a +  bi.

Example. Let
z — 2 +  3i and w = 1 — i.

Then
zw = (2 +  30(1 -  i) = 2(1 -  0 +  3i(l -  i)

- 2 - 2 i +  3i -  3i2 
= 2 +  3 +  i 
= 5 +  i.

Let z = a +  bi be a complex number. We define its complex conjugate 
(or simply its conjugate) to be the complex number

z = a — bi.

Thus if z = 2 +  3i, then z = 2 — 3i. We see at once that

zz = a2 +  b2.

Hence viewing z as a point in the complex plane, we see that zz is the square 
of the distance of this point from the origin (0, 0).

Let z = a +  bi be a complex number 5̂  0. Let
z

W ~ a2 +  b2'

Then, using the rules for multiplication, we obtain
zw = wz = 1,

because
z zz

Z a2 +  b2 ~ a2 +  b2



378 COMPLEX NUMBERS [15, §1]

This number w is called the (multiplicative) inverse of z, and is denoted 
by z~x, or 1/z. The proof given before that the multiplicative inverse is 
unique applies now. In other words, there exists one and only one complex 
number w such that wz = 1.

If z, w are complex numbers and z ^  0, then we write w/z instead of 
z~lw, just as we did with real numbers.

Example. To find the inverse of 1 +  i, we note that the conjugate of
1 +  i is 1 — i, and that

(1 +  £)( 1 “  i) = 2.
Hence

d  +  i ) - 1

Theorem  1. Let z, w be complex numbers. Then

Z W  =  Z W , Z  +  U) =  z +  w, z =  z.

Proof. The proofs follow immediately from the definitions of addition, 
multiplication, and the complex conjugate. We leave them to you as exercises.

Let z = x +  yi be a complex number, with real x, y. We shall call x the 
real part of z, and y  the imaginary part of z. These are denoted by Re(z) 
and Im (z), respectively.

Thus if z = x +  iy, then

z +  i  = 2x = 2 Re(z).
Similarly,

z -  z = 2y = 2 Im (z).

We define the absolute value of a complex number z = x +  iy to be

\z\ = V  x2 +  y 2.

Thus the absolute value of z is simply the distance from the origin to the 
point (x, y) in the plane. In terms of the absolute value, we can write

provided z ^  0. Indeed, we observe that

zz  =  \z\2.



[15, §1] THE COMPLEX PLANE 379

Theorem 2 . The absolute value of complex numbers satisfies the following 
properties. If z, w are complex numbers, then

\z +  w\ ^ \z\ +  \w\.

Proof. We have:

|zw;|2 = zwzw = zzwu; = |z|2|w;|2.

Taking the square root we conclude that \zw\ = \z\ \w\, thus proving the 
first assertion. As for the second, it is simply the triangle inequality. A 
simple algebraic proof can be given, but we omit it. Draw the picture of the 
points z, w, z +  w in the plane to see the parallelogram and the triangle.

y  are real numbers.

a) (1 +  i ) - 1

3. Let z be a complex number 5̂  0. What is the absolute value of z/z*i



380 COMPLEX NUMBERS [15, §2]

Let z = x +  iy be a complex number, which we view as a point (x, y) in 
the plane. Let r = \z\, Then

z 1
R  -  r 2

has absolute value 1, and consequently can be viewed as a point on the 
circle of radius 1 centered at the origin. Hence there exists some real number
0 such that

- = (cos 0, sin 0). r

This shows that we can write

z = r(cos 6 +  i sin 0).

Every complex number can be written as a product of a real number ^ 0 
and a complex number of absolute value 1.

Example. Let z = 1 +  i\/S. Then \z\ = 2. Hence

2 = 2 (cos 0, sin 0).

Note that cos 0 = J and sin 0 = V3/2. Hence 0 = 7r/3. We may say that 
the polar coordinates of z are (2, 7r/3).

We define the symbols eie by

eie = cos 6 +  i sin 0.
Then we have

z = x +  iy = re1’*.

§2. POLAR FORM

This is called the polar form of z, and is illustrated in Fig. 15-2. The notation 
eie would be terrible if the next theorem were not true. But since the next 
theorem is true, the notation is quite good.



[15, §2] POLAR FORM 381

= gi6+i<P'

Proof. We shall see that this amounts to the addition formula for the 
sine and cosine. By definition, we have

eio+iip = cos(0 j sin(0 +  ip).

Using the addition formula for the sine and cosine, we see that the preceding 
expression is equal to

cos 0 cos <p — sin 0 sin <p +  i(sin 0 cos ip +  sin <p cos 0).

This is exactly the same complex number that we get by multiplying

(cos 0 +  i sin 0)(cos (p +  i sin <p).

This proves Theorem 3.
Thus exponentiation with a complex number of the form id obeys the 

same basic rule as ordinary exponentiation.
Let z and w be complex numbers. Let us write them in polar form; 

namely
z = reie and w = sei<p, 

where r, s, 6, <p are real numbers. Then their product is equal to

zw = reidsei<p = rsei('d+<p).

Thus, to multiply complex numbers, we may say roughly that we multiply 
their absolute values and add their angles.

Example. Find a complex number whose square is 4eiw/2.
Let z = 2el>/4. Then, using Theorem 3, we find that

z2 = 4eîx/2.

Example. Let n be a positive integer. Find a complex number w such that
wn — eiir/2.

It is clear that the complex number w = eiw/2n satisfies our requirements. 

Example. We have

Theorem 3. Let 6, <p be real numbers. Then

eiir = —1 and e2wi = 1.

This follows at once from the definition and the known values of the sine 
and cosine.

76 Induction and Summations

§1. INDUCTION

Induction is an axiom which allows us to give proofs that certain prop­
erties are true for all integers.

Suppose that we wish to prove a certain assertion concerning positive 
integers n. Let A(n) denote the assertion concerning the integer n. To prove 
it for all n, it suffices to prove the following.

IND 1. The assertion A( 1) is true (i.e. the assertion concerning the 
integer 1 is true).

IND 2. Assuming the assertion proved for all positive integers ^ n, prove 
it for n +  1, i.e. prove that A(n +  1) is true.

The combination of these two steps is known as induction. For instance, 
IND 1 gives us a starting point, and IND 2 allows us to prove A (2) from 
A( 1), then A (3) from A (2), and so forth, proceeding stepwise.

We shall now give examples.

Example. For all integers n ^ 1, we have 

1 +  2 +  3 +  .- . +

Proof. By induction. The assertion A(n) is the assertion of the theorem. 
When n = 1, it simply states that

. K1 +  1)
1 ------- 2------

which is clearly true.
Assume now that the assertion is true for the integer n. Then

7i (n +  1)
l +  2 +  . . .  +  n + ( n  +  l ) =   ̂ Z  +  (* +  1).

383



384 INDUCTION AND SUMMATIONS [16, §1]

Putting the expression on the right of the equality sign over a common 
denominator 2, we see that it is equal to

it2 -j" 7i -j" 2/i +  2 (ti -j" 1)(ti -j" 2)
2 = 2

Hence assuming A(n), we have proved that

1 +  2 +  . •• +  (» +  ! ) -  (" +  »< "  + »  ,

which is none other than assertion A(n 4- 1)- This proves our result.

Notational remark. We have just written the sum of the first n positive 
integers above using three dots to denote intermediate integers. There is a 
notation which avoids the use of such dots, using a capital Greek sigma sign 
(22 f°r sum). Thus we write

n
23  ̂ = 1 +  2 +  • • • +  n.

k = i

Similarly, we write

23 k2 = l 2 4- 22 4- • • • 4- n2,
k  =  l

or also
n

23 sin k = sin 1 4- sin 2 4- ••• 4- sin /I.
k = i

If f  is any function, we would write

i ;  m  =  a d  +  /(2) +  • • • +  /(»).
k = l

We can write the distributivity with respect to a sum of n terms with the 
sigma notation as follows. For any number c, we have

C 2 ]  f (k )  =  2  c fik ).  
k = \  k = 1

For instance,

5 ±  k3 = ±  5k3.
k  =  l  k  =  l

Expanding with use of dots, we can also write this as

5(13 4- 23 4- • • • 4- n3) = 5 • l 3 4- 5 • 23 4- • • • 4- 5 • n3.



[16, §1] INDUCTION 385

Example. Let f  be a function defined for all real numbers such that

fix +  y) = f(x)f(y)

for all numbers x, y. Let /( l)  = a. We want to prove by induction that 
f(n) = an for all positive integers n. This is true for n = 1. Assume the 
result for an integer n. Then

f(n +  1) = f(n)f( 1) = ana = an+1,

thereby proving our assertion.

Example. We want a simple formula for the number of ways of selecting k 
objects out of a set of n objects. This number is denoted by C% and is called 
a binomial coefficient. The reason for this name is simple. Suppose that 
we wish to expand the product

(x +  y )n = (x +  y)(x +  y) • • • (x +  y)

as a sum of terms involving powers of x and y . In this expansion, we select 
x from k factors, and we select y  from n — k factors. We then take the sum 
over all possible such selections. Thus we find that

(x + y ) n = It Cnkxky n- k. 
k=0

It turns out that C£ has a simple expression. Let n! denote the product of the 
first n integers, so that

1! = 1,
2! = 1 - 2  = 2,
3! = 1 - 2 - 3  =6 ,
4! = 1 • 2 • 3 • 4 = 24,
5! = 1 • 2 • 3 • 4 • 5 = 120,

and so on. By convention, we define 0! = 1. Then the value for C% is given by

n = n\ 
k k\ (n -  k)\

For instance,

r 4 = 4! = = fi
2 2! (4 — 2)! 2 -2

It is very simple to prove by induction that C£ has the value described above, 
and we shall let you have fun with that, in Exercise 9. Instead of the notation

12. Theorem . All billiard balls have the same color.

Proof: By induction, on the number n of billiard balls. Our theorem is 
certainly true for n = 1, i.e. for one billiard ball. Assume it for n billiard 
balls. We prove it for n +  1. Look at the first n billiard balls among those 
n +  1. By induction, they have the same color. Now look at the last n 
among those n +  1. They have the same color. Hence all n +  1 have 
the same color (Fig. 16-1).

induction on n. First take n = 1. How many ways are there of mapping 
a single element into a set with m elements? Then assume the result for 
n, and prove it for n +  1, taking into account the number of possible 
ways of mapping the (n +  l)-th element of E into F.]

§2. SUMMATIONS

We have already met simple cases of summations in the preceding 
section, when we computed the values of certain sums. We shall give her- 
other applications of such summations.

We go back to the old problem of computing volumes, similar to thf 
problem of computing areas and lengths discussed in Chapter 7. We sha_ 
treat a typical example, and let you work out others along similar lines 
Our purpose is to compute the volume of a cone, of a ball, and me:- 
generally of a solid obtained by revolving a curve around an axis, which  ̂c 
take to be the jc-axis.



[16, §2] SUMMATIONS 389

We work out the volume of a cone in detail. In fact, we consider a special 
cone as shown on Fig. 16-2.

Fig. 16-2

We suppose that the height of the cone is equal to 1, and that the radius of 
the base is equal to 1 also. Then the cone is obtained by revolving the line 
y  = x around the jc-axis, between the values x = 0 and x = 1.

We wish to prove that the volume of this cone is equal to 7r/3. We use 
the method discovered by Archimedes. We first observe that the volume of 
a cylinder whose base has radius r and of height h as shown in Fig. 16-3 
is 7rr2h.

h

Fig. 16-3

Using this, we approximate the cone by cylinders as follows. Cut up the 
interval on the jc-axis between 0 and 1 into n segments of equal length 1 /n. 
The end points of these segments are the rational numbers

0, 1
n

71 — 1 n
n = 1.

Using general notation, we can say that the small segments are the segments

r* k \
l_7i n J

for k = 0, . . . , 7i. We use the notation [a, 6] to denote the set of all numbers 
x such that a S x S b.

We draw the cylinder whose height is 1 /n  and whose base is the disc of 
radius k/n centered at the point

as shown in Fig. 16-4(a) and (b).

Fig. 16—4

Fig. 16-4(b) is a cross section of Fig. 16-4(a), viewed from the side. The 
volume of each small cylinder is equal to 

a> %(£)•
Hence the sum of the volumes of the small cylinders is equal to

(2) -5 £*a-k = 0  71 \  /  71 k= 0

Of course, in the present case, the term in this sum corresponding to k = 0 
is equal to 0, so our sum is really equal to the sum

(3) 5  z  *2-
n k=i

If we use Exercise 2 of §1, then we get a simple expression for the value of



[16, §2] SUMMATIONS 391

fz\ n (n  +  l)(2n +  1),

You see this by dividing each expression n, n +  1, 2n +  1 by n, thus using 
up the n3 in the denominator.

Now as we let n get arbitrarily large, we see that the expression of (5) 
approaches the volume of the cone, and also approaches

This achieves what we wanted.
To get the volume of an arbitrary cone, we can proceed in two ways. 

Suppose that the cone has a base whose radius is r, and let the height be h. 
Thus we draw the cone as in Fig. 16-5.

around the jc-axis, between the values x = 0 and x = h. We could either 
follow the same method we used above, decomposing the segment [0, h\ into 
n segments of length h/n, forming the cylinders as before, taking the sum, 
and then taking the limit. We leave this as Exercise 1. We would then get:

The volume of a cone whose base has radius r and whose height is h is equal

r

Fig. 16-5

We see that the cone is obtained by rotating the line
r

to \irr2h.

But we can also proceed using mixed dilations, following the ideas of the 
exercises of Chapter 7, §1. Let us denote by C(r, h) the cone whose base has 
radius r and whose height is h. It should be intuitively clear (and we shall



392 INDUCTION AND SUMMATIONS [16, §2]

give a coordinate argument below) that C(r, h) is obtained by a mixed dila­
tion of the cone C( 1, 1) whose volume was obtained above. Namely, a point in 
3-space is described by three coordinates (jc, y, z). If a, b, c are three positive 
numbers, we let

Fa,b,c : R3 —► R3

be the map such that

Fa,b,c(x, y, Z)  = (ax, by, cz).

Then the cone C(r, h) is the image of the cone C(l, 1) under the mixed 
dilation

F h , r , r •

Fig. 16-6

Referring back to Chapter 7, suppose that we have a mixed dilation 
FGtbtC as above. If R is a rectangular solid whose sides have lengths t, u, r, 
then the dilation of R by Fa>btC is a rectangular solid whose sides have lengths 
at, bu, cv. The volume of R is tuv. and the volume of the dilated solid 
F a , b , c ( R ) is atbucv = abctuv. In other words, the volume gets multiplied by 
abc under the mixed dilation. If S is an arbitrary solid in 3-space, and if we 
approximate S by rectangular solids, then we conclude that a similar result 
holds for S. In other words, if V  is the volume of S, then

volume of Fa>b,c(S) = abcV.

In the application to the cone, we have a = h, b = r, c = r, so that

abc =  r2h.



[16, §2] SUMMATIONS 393

We can then conclude that the volume of C(r,h) is equal to hr2 times the 
volume of C( 1, 1). Thus we obtain the value

Let us now look more precisely at the reason why C(r,h) is the dilation of 
the cone C( 1, 1) by the mixed dilation Fhtr,r- First we must express the cone 
in terms of coordinates. Let (x, y 9 z) be the coordinates of a point in 3-space. 
If this point lies in the cone C(r, h)y then

0 ^ x ^ h.

For each such value of x, a point (x, y t z) lies in the cone if and only if

Volume of C(r, h) = -  irr2h.3

Thus the points on the cone C(r, h) can be described as those points (x, y, z) 
such that

yt2 2 < Xr2 •

Hence (x',y',z') is a point in the cone C(l, 1). Conversely, it is also clear 
that if (x',y',z') is a point in C(l, 1), then (xt y t z) is a point of C(ryh). 
Hence C(r, h) is the image of C(l, 1) under the mixed dilation

F h , r , r •

This concludes our argument.

§3. GEOMETRIC SERIES

Let c be a number with c ^ 1. We consider the sum

it Ck = l+ c +  c2 +  ■■■ +  cn.
k=0

Observe that

(1 +  c +  c2 +  • • • +  cn)(l -  c) = 1 -  cn+1.

This is immediate, using distributivity. There is a cancellation of all terms 
in the product, except 1 — cn+1. Thus we have

What happens when n becomes very large? If c > 1, then the power cn+1 
becomes large, and we don’t regard this as interesting.

Suppose however that 0 ^ c < 1. Then cn+1 approaches 0. For instance, 
suppose that c = J. Then

We see that the denominator is an increasing power of 2, and that the fraction 
for cn+1 thus approaches 0. Hence

1 — c

approaches 0 as n becomes arbitrarily large. Thus we may say that the sum

1 +  c +  c 2 +  • • • +  c n



[16, §3] GEOMETRIC SERIES 397

approaches

1 — c

as n becomes arbitrarily large. It is convenient to abbreviate this by the 
symbols

oc

£ « ‘ - r b -fc = l 1 — c

The symbol oc is called “ infinity” , and is explained only in terms of the 
context we have just introduced. Also, instead of saying “ as n becomes 
arbitrarily large” , we also say “ as n approaches infinity” .
Warning. There is no number called “ infinity” . The use of the word 
infinity is meaningful only as an abbreviation in the context just described.

when 0 < c < 1 , and this value is then 1/(1 — c) as above.

§1. MATRICES

An array of four numbers

A

is called a 2 X 2 matrix (read “ two by two matrix” ). For instance

is a 2 X 2 matrix. In a sense, a 2 X  2 matrix can be viewed as a generaliza­
tion of our “ pairs” , and this can be done in two ways: by looking at the rows 
or at the columns of the matrix. In our example, we have two rows,

These are called the first and second columns, respectively.
For this chapter, we call a pair of numbers, written either vertically or 

horizontally, a vector. If it is written vertically, we call it a column vector. 
If it is written horizontally, we call it a row vector.

Example. The row vectors of the matrix

(3, -5 )  and (2,7),

as well as two columns,

and

401



402 DETERMINANTS [17, §1]

are ( —6, 8) and (5, —3). The column vectors of this same matrix are

(D -  (>
We add column vectors componentwise, just as we added row vectors. 

For instance,

( X - 9 - Q -
Similarly, we multiply a column vector by a number, componentwise. For 
instance,

Thus writing pairs of numbers vertically is just a notational convenience to 
distinguish rows and columns; it does not affect the basic nature of the alge­
braic operations among them.

For a general 2 x 2  matrix

O '
we call

its first and second column, respectively. The numbers a, 6, c, d are called 
the components of the matrix. We write the components a, 6, c, d of a 
2 x 2  matrix also with subscripts:

(an ai2 
a2i a22

The first subscript indicates the row, and the second subscript indicates the 
column. For instance, ai2 means the component of the matrix in the first 
row and second column. Similarly, a22 means the component of the second 
row and second column.

Example. In the matrix

we have an = 3, a2i = 7, ai2 = —5, and 0,22 = 1.



[17, §1] MATRICES 403

With this subscript notation, we denote the rows by

A i = (an, ai2) and A 2 = (021, 022).

We denote the columns by

A ' -  and A2 -  M  .
\a2l/ \d22/

Thus we use a superscript like A 1, A 2 to denote columns instead of rows in 
a matrix A.

We can do similar things with a 3 X 3 matrix, which is an array of 
numbers as follows.

This 3 X 3  matrix has three rows denoted by A\, A 2, A 3 and three columns, 
denoted by A 1, A 2> A3. Its components are the numbers at;, where the 
indices i, j  range over the integers 1, 2, 3.

Example. The three columns of the matrix

For this matrix, we have a21 = 2 and ai2 = — 1.

Of course, we could now generalize further, and deal with 4 x 4  matrices, 
etc., but in the rest of the chapter, we study only 2 x 2  and 3 X 3  matrices. 
For the higher theory, look up my book Introduction to Linear Algebra.

It is natural to flip a 2 X  2 matrix or a 3 X  3 matrix across the diagonal, 
and to change rows into columns, or columns into rows. This process is

The three rows are

called transposition. Thus the transpose of the matrix

is the matrix

To give a numerical example, the transpose of the matrix

is the matrix
e -,d 
(.: ,d

Similarly, the transpose of a matrix

is the matrix

The transpose of a matrix A  is denoted by lA. The matrix

fan ai2 ai3N 
A  =  [ a 2 l  022  «2 3

is sometimes denoted by (at-y), where the first index i denotes the row, and 
the second index j  denotes the column. If A  = (atJ), then its transpose is 
denoted by

XA  =  ( a j i ) f

with a reversal of the indices i and j.
With this notation, we call the components atl of the matrix its diagonal 

components. Observe that the diagonal components remain unchanged 
when we transpose a matrix.

§2. DETERMINANTS OF ORDER 2

Let

A

be a 2 X 2 matrix. We define its determinant to be the number
ad — be.

Example. The determinant of the matrix

«
is equal to 3 • 7 — 1 • 6 = 15.

Example. The determinant of the matrix

(1 D
is equal to ( —2) • 8 — ( —5) • 4 = —16 +  20 = 4.

The determinant of the matrix A is denoted by the symbols

|A| = a b 
c d

Thus we have
- 2  - 5

4 8 = 4.

This notation is useful when we want to exhibit the components of the 
matrix. In other circumstances, it is useful to denote the determinant of A 
by the symbols

D(A),

which are short.
The determinant is an important tool for solving linear equations. We 

see this in the next theorem.

Theorem  1. Let a, 6, c, d, u, u be numbers. Assume that the determinant 
ad — be is not equal to 0. Then the system of linear equations

ax +  by = u, 
cx +  dy = v

has a unique solution.



[17, §2] DETERMINANTS OF ORDER 2 407

Proof. The proof follows the method which we have already met in 
Chapter 3, consisting of eliminating a variable. For instance, multiply the 
first equation by d, multiply the second by b, and subtract the second from 
the first. The term involving y  then becomes equal to 0, and we find that

adx — bcx = du — bv.

But adx — bcx = x(ad — be). Hence we find that if (x, y) is a solution, then

du — bv
(^  “  ad -  be'

Eliminating x instead of y  from the equations, we would find similarly that

av — cu
(2) ad — be

What these arguments show is that if the equations have a solution, then 
this solution is given by formulas (1) and (2). But, conversely, computing 
ax +  by with these values for x and y , we find u. Similarly, computing 
cx +  dy, we find v. For instance:

du — bv , , av — cu adu — abv +  bav — bcuax +  by = a — -----— +  b — -----— = ------------ - ------------------ = u,ad — be ad — be ad — be

because first abv cancels, and then ad — be cancels from the numerator and 
denominator, to yield u. This proves our theorem.

Observe that the solutions for x and y  are quotients of expressions which 
are themselves determinants. For instance, we can rewrite the expression 
for x and y  in the form

u b a u
v d c V

y  = -
a b a b
c d c d

Note how the column

occurs as the first column in the numerator for x, and how it occurs as the 
second column in the numerator for y. In both cases, the denominator is the 
determinant D(A) = ad — be. These facts are typical of the more general 
case to be studied later for 3 X 3  determinants.

In practice, for the 2 X 2  case, it is easier to work out the elimination method 
without determinants each time. However, we have described the method 
of determinants because in cases involving more unknowns, this method does 
become useful sometimes.

Theorem 2 . If A is a 2 X 2  matrix, then the determinant of A is equal 
to the determinant of the transpose of A. In other words,

D(A) = D (lA).

Proof. This is immediate from the definition of the determinant. We
have

and

\A\ = a b a cand |‘A| =
c d b d

ad — be = ad — cb.

Of course, the property expressed in Theorem 2 is very simple. We give 
it here because it is satisfied by 3 X 3 determinants which will be studied 
later.

We may view the determinant as a certain type of “ product” between the 
columns B and C. To what extent does this product satisfy the same rules as 
the product of numbers. Answer: To some extent, which we now determine 
precisely.

To begin with, this “ product” satisfies distributivity. In the determinant 
notation, this means:

D(B' +  B ", C) = D(B', C) +  D(B", C).

Similarly, if C = C' +  C", then

D(B, C' +  C") = D(B, C') +  D(B, C").

Proof. Of course, the proof is quite simple using the definition of the 
determinant. We have:

D l. If B = B' +  B ", i.e.

then

D(B' +  B ", C) = b\ +  b'{ d  
bf2 +  b'<2 C2

= (6'i +  b")c2 — (bf2 +  bf2)ci

= b\C2 +  b\C2 — 2̂C1 — b*2C\

= D(B’,C) +  D (B",C).

Distributivity on the other side is proved similarly.

D2. If x is a number, then

D(xB, C) = x - D(B, C) = D(B, xC).

Proof. We have:

Again, the other equality is proved similarly.

equal to 0. In other words,

These four basic properties are fundamental, and other properties can 
be deduced from them, without going back to the definition of the determinant 
in terms of the components of the matrix.

D5. If we add a multiple of one column to the other, then the value of the

D {B,B) = 0.

Proof. This is obvious, because

= 6162 — = 0.
02 02

determinant does not change. In other words, let x be a number. Then 

D(B +  xC, C) = D(B, C) and D(B, C +  xB) = D(B, C).

Written out in terms of components, the first relation reads

b\ +  xci c\ bi Ci 
62 +  xc 2 C2 &2 C2

Proof. Using Dl, D2, D4 in succession, we find that

D(B +  xC, C) = D(B, C) +  D(xC, C)

= D(B, C) +  xD(C, C) = D(B, C).

A similar proof applies to D(B, C +  xB).



412 DETERMINANTS [17, §3]

D6. If the two columns are interchanged, then the value of the determinant 
changes by a sign. In other words, we have

Proof. Again, we use Dl, D2, D4 successively, and get:

0 = D(B +  C ,B  +  C) = D(B, B +  C) +  D(C, B +  C)
= D(B, B) +  D(B, C) +  D(C, B) +  D(C, C) 
= D(£, C) +  Z)(C,£).

This proves that D(B,C) = — D(C, jB), as desired.

Of course, you can also give a proof using the components of the matrix. 
Do this as an exercise. However, there is some point in doing it as above, 
because in the study of determinants in the higher-dimensional case later, a 
proof with components becomes much messier, while the proof following the 
same pattern as the one we have given remains neat.

Observe that D6 shows that our determinant, viewed as a “ product,” 
is not commutative. Commutativity would mean that

and this is not true. Note that D6 was deduced from distributivity and the 
special property D4. The property expressed by D6 is often called anti- 
commutativity—“ anti” because of the minus sign which appears.

We can find the values of x and y  in Theorem 1, by using the properties 
we have just proved. This new argument is the one which generalizes later. 
It runs as follows. We wish to solve the system of linear equations

Observe how we have numbered the coefficients in such a way that we can 
write the columns easily, in an abbreviated fashion. Namely, (*) can be 
written in the form

D(B,C)  = - D ( C , B ) .

D(B,C) = D(C,B),

Suppose that x, y  are solutions of the system (**). Using our properties of 
the determinant, we have:

D(C, B) = D(xA +  y B , B) = D(xA, B) +  D(yB, B)
= xD(A, B) +  ;yD(B, B)
= xZ>(A, B).

Hence we find that

x = £>(C, B)

If you compare this with the solution found previously you will find, of course, 
that we have obtained the same value, namely a quotient of determinants 
whose denominator is the determinant of the coefficients of the equations. 
Similarly, you can find the value for y  using the same method. Do it as an 
exercise.

414 DETERMINANTS [17, §4]

We shall define the determinant for 3 x 3  matrices, and we shall see 
that it satisfies properties analogous to those of the 2 X 2 case.

Let

§4. DETERMINANTS OF ORDER 3

A = (dij) =

be a 3 X 3 matrix. We define its determinant according to the formula 
known as the expansion by a row, say the first row. That is, we define

(1) D(A)  = an a  22 Û23 Û21 Û23
+  CL 13 Û21 Û22— a \ 2 •

Û32 a  33 Û31 a  33 CL 31 Û32

and we denote D(A)  also with the two vertical bars

a n a i2 CLlZ

D(A) = Û21 Û22 CL23

Û31 CL32 CL 33

We may describe the sum in (1) as follows. Let A»y be the matrix obtained 
from A by deleting the i-th row and j-th column. Then the sum for D(A)  
can be written as

a n D ( A n )  — a\2D(A\2) + a i s D ( A i s ) .

In other words, each term consists of the product of an element of the first 
row and the determinant of the 2 X 2 matrix obtained by deleting the first 
row and the j-th column, and putting the appropriate sign to this term as 
shown.

Example. Let

Then

A =

An “ C 5) ’ A i 2 ‘ ( - 3  5) '  A , 3 * ( - 3  2)



[17, §4] DETERMINANTS OF ORDER 3 415

and our formula for the determinant of A yields

1 4 1 4 1 1-  1 +  o2 5 - 3  5 - 3  2
= 2(5 -  8) -  1(5 +  12) +  0 
= -23.

Thus the determinant is a number. To compute this number in the above 
example, we computed the determinants of the 2 X 2  matrices explicitly. 
We can also expand these in the general definition, and thus we find a six- 
term expression for the determinant of a general 3 x 3  matrix A = (at;), 
namely:

(2)
D(A)  = 011022033 — 011032023 “  <*12021033

+  <*12023031 +  <Z13<Z21<Z32 — <Zl3022<Z31-

Do not memorize (2). Remember only (1), and write down (2) only when 
needed for specific purposes.

We could have used the other rows to expand the determinant, instead 
of the first row. For instance, the expansion according to the second row is 
given by

a i2 a i3
+  CL22

a n «1 3 a n a i2
021 — Ö23

« 3  2 033 031 CL 33 a 3 i 032

= — a2i-D(A2i) +  a22D{A22) — a2̂ D(A2s).

Again, each term is the product of a 2j with the determinant of the 2 x 2  
matrix obtained by deleting the second row and y-th column, together with 
the appropriate sign in front of each term. This sign is determined according 
to the pattern:

If you write down the two terms for each one of the 2 x 2  determinants in 
the expansion according to the second row, you will obtain six terms, and you 
will find immediately that they give you the same value which we wrote down 
in formula (2). Thus expanding according to the second row gives the same 
value for the determinant as expanding according to the first row.



416 DETERMINANTS [17, §4]

Furthermore, we can also expand according to any one of the columns. 
For instance, expanding according to the first column, we find that

a 22 a 23 a i2 a i s
+  a 3 i

a i2 a i s
a n — a 2 i

a s  2 a s s a s  2 a33 a22 a2 s

yields precisely the same six terms as in (2), if you write down each one of 
the two terms corresponding to each one of the 2 X 2  determinants in the 
above expression.

Example. We compute the determinant
3 0 1
1

-1
2 5 
4 2

by expanding according to the second column. The determinant is equal to

3 1 
1 5

3 1 
- 1  2

-  4 2(6 -  ( -1 ) )  -  4(15 -  1) = -42 .

Note that the presence of 0 in the first row and second column eliminates one 
term in the expansion, since this term is equal to 0.

If we expand the above determinant according to the third column, we 
find the same value, namely

+ 1 1 2 3 0 3 0-  5 +  2- 1  4 - 1  4 1 2
= -42 .

Theorem 3 . If A is a 3 x 3  matrix, then D(A)  = D(lA). In other 
words, the determinant of A is equal to the determinant of the transpose of A.

Proof. This is true because expanding D(A)  according to rows or columns 
gives the same value, namely the expression in (2).

EXERCISES
1. Write down the expansion of a 3 X 3 determinant according to the third 

row, the second column, and the third column, and verify in each case

418 DETERMINANTS [17, §5]

We shall now see that 3 x 3  determinants satisfy the properties D1 
through D6, listed previously for 2 x 2  determinants. These properties are 
concerned with the columns of the matrix, and hence it is useful to use the 
same notation which we used before. If A 1, A 2, A3 are the columns of the 
3 X 3  matrix A, then we write

D(A)  = D ( Al, A2, A3).

For the rest of this section, we assume that our column and row vectors have 
dimension 3; that is, that they have three components. Thus any column 
vector B in this section can be written in the form

§5. PROPERTIES OF 3 X 3 DETERMINANTS

B =

Dl. Suppose that the first column can be written as a sum,

A 1 = B +  C,

that is,

Then

D(B +  C, A 2, A3) = D(B, A2, A3) +  D(C, A2, A3).

and the analogous rule holds with respect to the second and third columns.

Proof. We use the definition of the determinant, namely the expansion 
according to the first row. We see that each term splits into a sum of two 
terms corresponding to B and C. For instance,

a22 023 a22 a23 +  Ci a22 a23a n = bia3i 033 031 033 a3i 033

b2 + C2 a23 b2 a2s C2 a23
a i2

bs +

bs

C3 a33 033 C3 a33

b2 + C2 a22 b2 a22
+  a i3

C2 a22
a i3

bs +
=  CL13

bsC3 a32 032 C3 032

Summing with the appropriate sign yields the desired relation.



[17, §5] PROPERTIES OF 3 X  3 DETERMINANTS 419

D2. If  x is a number, then

D(xA\  A 2, A3) = jc • D(A\  A 2, A3), 

and similarly for the other columns.

Proof. We have:

« 2 2 « 2 3 * a 2 i <*23
+  a i 3

* « 2 1 « 2 2xan — a i 2
a  32 « 3 3 xaz i « 3 3 * 0 3 1 0 3 2

=  j c -Z)(A\ A 2, A3).

The proof is similar for the other columns.

In the 3 x 3  case, we also have the unit vectors, namely

and the unit 3 x 3  matrix, namely

D3. If E is the unit matrix, then D(E) = D(El, E2, E3) =  1.

Proof. This is obvious from the expansion according to the first row.

D4. If two columns of the matrix are equal, then the determinant is equal 
to 0.

Proof. Suppose that A 1 = A 2, and look at the expansion of the deter­
minant according to the first row. Then an = ai2, and the first two terms 
cancel. The third term is equal to 0 because it involves a 2 X 2 determinant 
whose two columns are equal. The proof for the other cases is similar. 
(Other cases: A 2 = A3 and A 1 = A3.)

Observe that to prove our basic four properties, we needed to use the 
definition of the determinant, i.e. its expansion according to the first row. 
For the remaining properties, we can give a proof which is not based directly 
on this expansion, but only on the formalism of D1 through D4. This has 
the advantage of making the arguments easier, and in fact of making them 
completely analogous to those used in the 2 x 2  case. We carry them out.



420 DETERMINANTS [17, §5]

D5. If we add a multiple of one column to another, then the value of the 
determinant does not change. In other words, let x be a number. Then 
for instance

D(A\ A 2 +  x A 1, A 3) = D{A\ A 2, A 3),

and similarly in all other cases.

Proof. We have

ZKA1, A 2, +  xA\  A3) = ZKA1, A 2, A 3) +  ZKA1, jcA1, A3) (by D l)
= D (A l, A 2, A 3) +  jc • D (A l, A 1, A3) (by D2) 
= D (A l, A 2, A3) (by D4).

This proves what we wanted. The proofs of the other cases are similar.

D6. If two adjacent columns are interchanged, then the determinant changes 
by a sign. In other words, we have

D(A\  A 3, A 2) = —D (A l, A 2, A3),

and similarly in the other case.

Proof. We use the same method as before. We find:

0 = D{A\ A 2 +  A 3, A 2 +  A3)
= D (A l, A 2, A 2 +  A3) +  D (A l, A 3, A 2 +  A 3) 
= D (A l, A 2, A 2) +  D (A l, A 2, A3) +  D (A l, A 3, A 2) +  D (A l, A3, A 3)
= D (A l, A 2, A 3) +  ZKA1, A 3, A 2),

using D l and D4. This proves D6 in this case, and the other cases are proved 
similarly.

Using these rules, especially D5, we can compute determinants a little 
more efficiently. For instance, we have already noticed that when a 0 occurs 
in the given matrix, we can expand according to the row (or column) in 
which this 0 occurs, and it eliminates one term. Using D5 repeatedly, we can 
change the matrix so as to get as many zeros as possible, and then reduce the 
computation to one term.

Example. Compute the determinant

3 0 1
1 2  5 -

- 1 4  2



[17, §5] PROPERTIES OF 3 X 3 DETERMINANTS 421

We already have 0 in the first row. We subtract two times the second row 
from the third row. Our determinant is then equal to

3 0 1 

1 2  5 • 

- 3  0 - 8

We expand according to the second column. The expansion has only one term
0, with a +  sign, and that is:

The 2 x 2  determinant can be evaluated by our definition of ad — be, and 
we find the value

2(—24 -  (-3)) =  -42.

Example. We compute the determinant

4 7 10 

3 7 5 -  

5 - 1  10

We subtract two times the second row from the first row, and then from the 
third row, yielding

- 2 - 7 0

3 7 5 y
- 1 - 15 0

which we expand according to the third column, and get

-5(30 -  7) = -5(23) = -115.

Note that the term has a minus sign, determined by our usual pattern of 
signs.

424 DETERMINANTS [17, §6]

We now come to solving linear equations in three unknowns using deter­
minants. For practical purposes, the simple-minded elimination method of 
Chapter 2, §2, is the easiest to use when the equations are explicitly given 
with numerical coefficients, and you don’t need any harder theory, like that 
of determinants. For theoretical purposes, however, and for more advanced 
computations, the theory of determinant can often be used advantageously, 
and that is the reason why we now go into it.

We can write a system of linear equations

<*11*1 +  ai2X2 +  ai3*3 = &i 
( * )  021*1 +  a 22*2 +  023*3 =  b2

« 3 1 * 1  +  0 3 2 * 2  +  0 3 3 * 3  =  &3

using the vector notation, in the form

(**) jciA1 +  JC2A 2 +  *3 A3 = B ,

where A 1, A 2, A3 are the columns of the matrix of coefficients a*y, and B is 
the column formed by 61, 62, &3-

Theorem 4. Let x\, *2, *3 be numbers which are solutions of the system of 
linear equations above. Let A  = (a»y) be its matrix of coefficients. If  
D(A) 7* 0, then

D(B, A 2, A 3) _  D ( A \ B , A 3)
Xl ~ D {A l, A 2, A 3) *2 -  D(Ai, A 2, A 3) ’

Note. The practicality of our notation now becomes really apparent. It is 
obviously much longer and more tiring to write out all the components than 
to write out the expressions with the abbreviation for the columns as in 
D(B , A 1, A 2), etc.



[17, §6] c r a m e r ’ s  r u l e 425

Proof of Theorem 4. We use the same technique as for the proof of the 
2 X 2 case. We have:

D(B, A 2, A3) = D(xiAl +  x2A 2 +  x3A3, A 2, A3)
= xiD(A\  A 2, A 3) +  x2D (A2, A 2, A3) +  x:iD(A3, A 2, A3)
= xiIK A 1, A 2, A3).

The first equality follows from D1 and D2. As an exercise, write out the 
missing steps (Exercise 1). The second equality follows from D4. If 
D(A) 0, then we get the desired expression for xi. We treat x2 and X3 
similarly (Exercise 2 ).

Theorem 4 is known as Cramer’ s rule.
Observe that Theorem 4 does not tell us that a solution exists. It tells 

us that if a solution exists, then it is given by the formulas as in the theorem. 
In fact, the following is true.

Theorem 5. Let A be a 3 X 3 matrix whose determinant is not 0. Then 
for any column B there exist numbers xi, x2, X3 such that

x\A 1 +  X2A 2 +  X3A 3 = B.

In other words, the system of linear equations (*) has a solution.

The proof for Theorem 5 is slightly more involved than in the analogous 
2 X 2 case, and we shall omit it.

Example. We solve the following system of linear equations by Cramer’s 
rule.

3x +  2y +  4z = 1 
2x — y  +  z = 0 

x +  2y +  3z = 1

1. (a +  b) +  (c +  d) = a +  b +  c +  d by associativity 

= a + b + d + c  = a + d + b + c
by commutativity 

= (a +  d) +  (b +  c) by associativity
3. (a — b) +  (c — d ) = a  — b +  c — d by associativity

= a +  c — b — d by commutativity 
= (a +  c) +  ( — b — d) by associativity

6. (a — b) +  (c — d) = a — b +  c — d by associativity
= —b +  a +  c — d = —b a — d -J- c 
= —b — d +  a +  c by commutativity 
= — (6 +  d) +  (a +  c) by associativity and N5

11. It suffices to show that (a +  b +  c) +  ( —a) +  ( —6) +  ( — c) = 0.
But (a +  b +  c) +  ( —a) +  ( — b) +  ( — c)

= a +  b +  c — a — b — c by associativity 
= a +  b — a +  c — b — c\
= a — a +  b +  c — b — c> by commutativity 
= a — a +  b — b +  c — c)
= (a — a) +  (b — b) +  (c — c) by associativity 
= 0 + 0 + 0 = 0

13. Same type of proof. We must show that (a — b) +  b — a = 0. We have: 
a — b +  b — a = a — b — a +  b

= a — a — b +  b by commutativity 
= (a — a) +  ( — b +  b) by associativity 
= 0 + 0 = 0  

15. x = —3 17. x = 5 19. x = - 3
22. Let a +  b = a +  c. Adding —a to both sides, we get —a +  a +  b =

— a +  a +  c, that is, ( —a +  a) +  b = ( —a +  a) +  c by associa­
tivity. Then 0 +  b = 0 +  c, i.e., b = c.

Setting k = n +  m gives a +  6 = 2k, whence a +  6 is even,
b) If a = 2n +  1, 6 = 2m, then a +  6 = 2 n + l  +  2m = 2(n +  m) +  1. 

Setting k = n +  m gives a +  6 = 2k +  1, and a +  6 is odd.

8. Suppose that there exists a rational number a = m/n, written in lowest 
form, such that a3 = (m/n)3 = 2. Then m3 = 2n3. Thus m3 is even, 
and hence m is even (proof similar to the one about m2 and m). We 
can write m = 2p for some integer p. Thus m3 = 2(4p3). Going back 
to m3 = 2n3, this yields 2n3 = 2(4p3), that is, n3 = 4p3 = 2(2p3). 
Consequently, n3 is even and n is even. Thus both m and n are even, 
which is impossible.

so that ac < 6c.
2. ac < be < bd, using IN 2 twice.
3. ac > be > bd, using IN 3 twice.
4. a) x positive implies y  positive. Then 1/x and 1/y are also positive.

Multiply each side of the inequality x < ^ by 1/x. We get 1 = 
x/x < y/x. Multiply each side of this last inequality by 1/y . We 
get 1/y < 1/x, as desired,

b) Multiply each side of the inequality a/6 < c/d by d, and then by 6. 
You get ad < 6c. Conversely, multiply each side of the inequality 
ad < be by 1/d and 1/6.

5. We must verify that (6 +  c) — (a +  c) is positive. But (6 +  c) — 
(a +  c) = 6 +  c — a — c = 6 — a, which is positive by assumption. 
Also, (6 — c) — (a — c) = 6 — c — a +  c = 6 — a, which is positive. 
Hence (6 — c) > (a — c).

6. We have a2 = aa < ab < 66 = 62, using IN 2 twice. Next, multiplying 
each side of the inequality a2 < 62 by a, we get a3 < ab2, and multiply­

ing each side of the inequality a < b by b2 we get ab2 < 63, whence 
a3 < 63. Continuing in this way yields the general result.

7. Let r = a1/n and s = b1/n. If r ^ s, then we know from Exercise 6 that 
rn ^ sn, or in other words, a ^ b. But this contradicts our assumption. 
Hence r < s.

8. a) Use Exercise 4 (b). The inequality a/b < (a +  c)/(b +  d) is equiva­
lent with a(b +  d) < b(a +  c) by cross multiplication, and this is 
equivalent with ab +  ad < ba +  be, which is equivalent with 
ad < be, which is true by multiplying each side of the inequality 
a/b < c/d by b and d.

As for the inequality on the right-hand side, it is equivalent by 
cross multiplication with d(a +  c) < c(b +  d), which is equivalent 
with da +  dc < cb +  cd, which is equivalent with da < cb, which is 
equivalent by cross multiplication with a/b < c/d, which is true by 
assumption.

b) The left inequality is equivalent by cross multiplication with 
a(b +  rd) < b(a +  re), which is equivalent with ab +  ard < ba +  
brc, which is equivalent with ard < brc. Multiplying both sides by 
r“ 1, which is positive, this last inequality is equivalent with ad < be, 
which is true by cross multiplication of the assumed inequality 
a/b < c/d.

The argument for the right inequality works again by cross mul­
tiplication.

c) By cross multiplication, it suffices to prove that (a +  rc)(b +  sd) < 
(a +  sc)(b +  rd), and this is equivalent with ab +  rcb +  asd +  
rscd < ab +  scb +  ard +  rscd, which is equivalent with rcb +  
asd < scb +  ardy which is equivalent with r(bc — ad) < s(bc — ad). 
Since r < s and be — ad > 0, this last inequality is true, and our 
assertion is proved.

If d(0, P) = d(0,Q), that is, d(0, P)2 = rf(0,Q)2, then (I) gives 
d(P, M )2 = d(M, Q)2, that is, d(P, M) = d(M, Q).

10. In the first case, the picture is as follows.

The triangles A PQNand A PNM  are right triangles, and hence m(A\) +  
m(B) = 90°, m(A2) +  m(C) = 90°. Adding these, we find m(A\) +  
m(A2) +  m(B) +  m(C) = 180°. But m(A) = m(A\) +  m(A2)f so that 
we proved what we wanted.

In the second case, the picture is as follows.

Then A PQN is a right triangle, and so is A PMN, with right angle at N . 
Hence (*) m(A\) +  m(B) = 90°, m(A2) +  m(C') = 90°, where C' is 
the supplementary angle to C, i.e., m(C) +  m(C') = 180°, so that 
m(C) = 180° — m(C'). Subtracting the expressions in (*), we find 
77l(Ai) — 77l(A2) +  77lCB) — 77l(C') = 0°. But 77l(A) = 77l(Ai) — 771(^2). 
Substituting the value for 77i(C'), we get 771(A) +  m(B) +  771(C) = 180°.

4. The lines F(L) and F(K) cannot have a point in common, otherwise 

this point would be of the form F(P) = F(Q) for some point P on L 
and Q on K. But the distance between P and Q is the same as the dis­
tance between F(P) and F(Q)y and it would then follow that d(P, Q) =
0, so P = Q, which is impossible. Hence F(L) and F(K) have no point 
in common, and are therefore parallel.

Let M  be the point of intersection of L and K. Let O be a point of L, 
not on K. Let P, Q be points on K  lying on opposite sides of M , at the 
same distance from M. Thus d(0, P) = d(0, Q). Since F is an isometry, 
we have d(F(0)t F{P)) = d(F(0)y F(Q)). Furthermore, F(P) and F(Q) 
are distinct, lie on F{K)t at the same distance from F(M)y again because 
F is an isometry. From the corollary of Pythagoras, it follows that F(0) 
lies on the perpendicular bisector of the segment between F(P) and F(Q). 
The line F(L) is the unique line which passes through F(0) and F(M)y 
and is therefore perpendicular to the line F(K)y which is the unique line 
passing through F(P) and F(Q).

6. Theorems 1 and 2 are valid.
Theorem 4. If P, Q, R, S are four points which do not lie in a plane and 
are fixed by an isometry f of 3-space, then f is the identity.

Proof. Observe first that P , Q, R do not lie on a line. Otherwise, this 
line and S lie in a plane, which would contradict the assumption of the 
theorem. Let V  be the plane passing through P, Q, R. Arguing as above, 
the points S, P, Q do not lie on a line. Let U be the plane passing through 
S, P, Q. (We assume that if three points are not on a line, then there 
exists one and only one plane passing through them.) By Theorem 3, the 
isometry f  leaves U and V  fixed. Let X  be a point in 3-space. We want 
to show that f(X ) = X. If X  lies in U or V, we are done. Assume that 
X  does not lie in U or V. If X  lies on the line between S and Rf then X  
is fixed by Theorem 2. Assume that X  does not lie on the line between 
S and R. Let W  be the plane passing through X, S, R. We assume that 
the intersection of two planes is a line. Let L be the intersection of W  
and U. Since L lies in Ut it is fixed by /. Since R is not in the plane U, 
it follows that R is not in L. We assume that given a line and a point 
not on the line, there exists a unique plane passing through the line and 
the point. Thus W  is the unique plane passing through R and L. Any 
two points on L are fixed by /, and hence by Theorem 3, the plane W  is 
fixed by /. Since X  lies in W, we conclude that X  is fixed by /, thereby 
proving Theorem 4.

S 'is  contained in F(S). Proof. Let Q 'be on S'. Using F-1, we have 
similarly F -1 (Q') on S, and thus F (F_1(Q')) = Q' is in F(S).

2. There exists a translation T such that T(P') = P. This reduces our 
proof to the case when P = P', which we now assume. Since d(P, Q) = 
d(P, Q'), there exists a rotation R with respect to P such that R(Q) = Q'. 
This concludes the proof.

3. Since FoH  = F©G, we get F_1 © (FoH) = F_1o(FoG).
Using the associativity of mappings we get (F_1 oF)oH = (F_1oF)oG, 
whence H  = G.

4. a) F2 = I  and F3 = 7. But F3 = F©F2, thus F3 = I = F o l ,
i.e. F = I.
Fs = F3oF5, thus I = F3oI, i.e. F3 = I. F5 = F3oF2, thus 
7 = 7oF2, i.e. F2 = 7. F3 = F©F2, thus 7 = Fo7, i.e. F = I.

5. F(P) = G(P) implies P = (F_1oG)(P). F(Q) = G(Q) implies 
Q = (F "1oG)(Q). F(M) = G(M) implies M  = (F "1oG)(M).
F _1 ©G is an isometry with 3 fixed points P, Q, Af. Hence F_1o G = 7, 
whence F oF_1oG = F, i.e. F = G.

isometries F\t or F\ o F2, or F\ o F2 0 P3, such that each one of Fi, F2, P3 
has an inverse (because they are the identity, or a translation, or a re­

by F f 1, F ^ o F f 1, and F ^ o F ^ o F f 1.

Fi(S) = S'. Furthermore, S' congruent to S" means that there exists

F2(Fi(S)) = S". Since F2 °Fi is an isometry, it follows that S is con­

3. Let the two squares have corners at P, Q, Af, iV and P', Q', Af', iV7 
respectively, as shown. Since PQ and P'Q' have the same length, there 
exists an isometry which maps P on P ' and Q on Q', say by Theorem 8.

Thus we may assume that P = P ' and Q = Q'. In this case, either 
M  = Af' or M  7* M '. If Af = Af', then iV is the point of intersection 
of the line through Af parallel to PQ, and the line through Q, perpendic­
ular to PQ. Similarly, N ' is this same point of intersection, so that 
N  = iV'. It follows that in the present case, the squares coincide. If 
Af 7* Af', then the reflection through the line L pq maps Af on Af', and 
reduces our problem to the preceding case.

We draw the triangle A  PQM. Let the line perpendicular to PQ, passing 
through M y intersect PQ at the point N f as shown. Then A  M N P  and 
AMNQ are right triangles. By the known theorem on the sum of the 
angles of a right triangle, it follows that the angles Z.PM N  and Z.NMQ 
both have 30°. Hence if we reflect the line L p M through the line L Mn , we 
obtain the line L Mq.  This reflection maps the line Lpq on itself. Since P 
is the intersection of LpM and L p q , its image by the reflection is the inter­
section of L m q  and L p q , which is Q. Hence our reflection maps M P  on 
MQy and these two sides therefore have the same length. The same 
argument applies to another pair of sides.

7. By an isometry we can map P on P' and Q on Q'. This reduces us to the 
case when P = P' and Q = Q', which we now assume. The picture is 
then as follows.

The angles of the two triangles with vertex at Q have the same measure. 
If M  and M' lie on the same side of the line L p q , then they lie on the 
same ray with vertex at Q. Since d(Qf M) = d(Qf M')f it follows that 
M  = M'y and we are done. If M  and M' lie on opposite sides of the line 
L p q , then we reflect through this line to get them on the same side, and 
this reduces our problem to the case already taken care of.

5. The segment PQ consists of all points of the form tP +  (1 — t)Q,

0 ^ t ^ 1. Apply Ta to such points. We get tP +  (1 — t)Q +  A = 
t(P +  A) +  (1 — t)(Q +  A), 0 ^ t ^ 1, because iA +  (1 — t)A = A. 
Therefore the image of PQ by TU consists of all points on the segment 
whose end points are P +  A and Q +  A.

implies ai&2 — a2bi = 0.

given by those values of t such that (p +  at)2 +  (9 +  &£)2 = r2, that is 
(a2 +  b2)t2 +  2(ap +  bq)t +  (p2 +  q2 — r2) = 0. Then

t = — (ap +  bq) ±  > /(ap +  bq)2 +  (a2 +  62)(r2 — p 2 — g2)

The square root is defined since (ap +  bq)2 ^ 0, (a2 +  b2) ^ 0, r2 ^

2. Note that 1 / c o s j c  decreases from arbitrarily large values to 1, in the 
interval — tt/ 2  ^  jc ^  0 . Furthermore, — sin x decreases from 1 to 0  in 
this interval. Since cos x and —sin x are both positive in this interval, 
we conclude that — tan* = —sinjc/cosjc decreases from arbitrarily 
large values to 0. Hence tan x itself increases from arbitrarily large nega­
tive values to 0.

10. Let Se be the set of all distinct even permutations.
Let Se = {<ti, (T2y . . . , cTm} and let S' = {rcri, ro-2, . . . , rcrm}, with r being 
a transposition. Each is even. Hence T<n is odd. We now prove that 
all the elements of the set S' are distinct. If rvk = raj, then multiplying 
on the left by r shows that ak = o';, so that k = j  and ak = <?j. Finally, 
we must prove that S' contains all odd permutations. Let a be an odd 
permutation. Then ra is even and ra = cr* for some k. Hence a = 

= T(Tky and a is in S'.
11. Property is true for n = 1. Assume it for n. Suppose that na = Tj<r' 

for some indices i,j  and some a, a' in Sn. Since na(n +  1) = i and 
Tj(Tr(n +  1) = j, it follows that n  = 7> Multiplying on the left by 
Ti ( =Tj)y we conclude that a = cr'. If cr' = rtcr, then again looking at 
the effect on the number n +  1, we conclude that this cannot be so. 
Hence the permutations cr, t\<t, . . . , Tna with a in Sn are all distinct.

Furthermore, if 7 is a permutation of e/n+i, then either 7 leaves n +  1 
fixed, in which case 7 is already in Sn, or 7(n +  1) = i for some i with
1 ^ i ^ n. In this case rt7 leaves n +  1 fixed, so 7\7 = a is an element 
of Sn, and 7 = tut. Thus we have found all the permutations of e/n+i. 
We assume by induction that there are n\ permutations in Sn. To each 
a in Sn we have associated the n +  1 permutations a, r\a, . . . , rn<r in 
Sn+i. Hence the total number of permutations in Sn+i is

in +  1 )n\ = (n +  1)!.

Z = (x — iy) = x +  iy = z

5. Im(z) = y; we always have y <  \y\, thus Im(z) <  |Im(z)|. Next, 
y 2 <  x2 +  y 2 because x2 >  0. Hence \y\ = V y 2 ^ V x 2 +  y 2 = \z\. 
These two inequalities together constitute the desired inequalities, 
namely Im (z) ^ |Im(z)| ^ \z\.

3. Suppose a, /3 are complex numbers such that a2 = /32 = z. Then 
a2 — ft2 = 0 so that (a +  /3)(a — /3) = 0. Hence a = 0 or a = —ft. 
So there are at most two such complex numbers. But if z = re*, then 
a = r1/2e^/2 and —a have squares equal to z.

OTHER BOOKS OF INTEREST 

A FIRST COURSE IN CALCULUS, Second Edition
By Serge Lang 316 pp, 28 illus (1968)
This text covers the basic notions of derivative and integral and the basic 
techniques and applications which accompany them. This edition includes a 
discussion of complex numbers and greatly expanded exercise sets.

A SECOND COURSE IN CALCULUS, Second Edition
By Serge Lang 305 pp, 116 illus (1968)
This book is a continuation of the author’s A First Course in Calculus, 
Second Edition and deals principally with functions of several variables. The 
two books together are designed for a two-year course in analytic geometry, 
calculus, and linear algebra. They are also available as one volume: A Com­
plete Course in Calculus (Addison-Wesley, 1968).

INTRODUCTION TO UNEAR ALGEBRA
By Serge Lang 180 pp, 49 illus, paperbound (1970)
This text can be used for an independent short course in the elements of 
linear algebra or as a supplement to the calculus sequence. The author con­
centrates on the natural bases and has included excellent applications to 
geometry. This book will probably find its greatest use at the end of the 
freshman year after the student has completed the basics of one-variable 
calculus, although it can also serve as an introduction to some algebra previ­
ous to the calculus.

LINEAR ALGEBRA, Second Edition
By Serge Lang In press (1971)

For linear algebra courses at the undergraduate level, this book contains 
enough material for a one-year course. It covers vector spaces, matrices, linear 
maps, and determinants in greater detail than the first edition. Many new 
examples and exercises have been added to this edition, and the author has 
extensively revised the first half of the book. New material on unitary maps 
over the reals, the Jordan canonical form, and spectral theorem has also been 
introduced.
